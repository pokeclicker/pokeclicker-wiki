In the Hatchery, you can hatch [[Eggs]] and breed [[Pokémon]] that have reached level 100. Breeding is the primary way of increasing a Pokémon's attack stat.

The Hatchery is unlocked upon clearing [[Routes/Kanto Route 3]].

## Hatchery Basics {#basics}

#### How to Use {#howto}
Only eggs and Pokémon that are Level 100 can be bred in the Hatchery. In the Hatchery modal, click on the Pokémon to breed it or add it to the queue. To hatch an egg, go to the Egg tab. Each Pokémon has a required amount of egg steps before it can hatch. When enough steps have been completed, click on its egg to hatch it.

Every time a Pokémon is bred, its **attack** increases by its **attack bonus** amount. The efficiency of a Pokémon's attack gain can be [modified](#breedingefficiency).

While a Pokémon is in the Hatchery (including the queue), its attack **does not** count toward your battles.

[[Hatchery Helpers]] are helpers that automate adding Pokémon to the Hatchery for a fee.

#### Hatchery Slots and Queue {#slotsqueue}
The Hatchery has a maximum of 4 slots. The first one is free, and subsquent ones must be purchased with [[Quest Points]].

Starting from Johto, you have a Hatchery queue, which allows you to queue Pokémon and eggs to be hatched. Every time a new [region](#!Regions) is unlocked, your Hatchery queue expands in size.

#### Exclusive Pokémon {#exclusives}
[[Baby Pokémon]] are exclusively unlocked through breeding the evolved stage of that Pokémon. When a Baby Pokémon hatches, the player will obtain both the original evolved stage and the baby stage of that Pokémon.

Some Pokémon can only be unlocked by hatching it from an [egg](#!Eggs).

#### Hatching Shiny Pokémon {#shinypokemon}
Breeding Pokémon offers the highest [shiny odds](#!Shiny_Chance) in the game (alongside [[Wandering Pokémon]] and [[Shop Pokémon]]) at **1/1024**.

A hatch resulting in a shiny Pokémon will grant the Pokémon **5 times the usual attack gain**. Note that the existing shiny status of a Pokémon does not matter. If you breed an already-shiny Pokémon, it will only receive the bonus if it hatches as a shiny again.

## Egg Step Gain {#eggstepgain}
Egg steps are gained by:
- Defeating Pokémon in [[Routes]], [[Gyms]], [[Dungeons]], and [[Battle Frontier]]
- Walking in the [[Safari]]

Generally, the amount of steps you receive scales with the difficulty of the location.

#### Modifiers {#eggstepsmult}

| Modifer | Egg Step Gain Multiplier |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[File:Magma_Stone.png\|24px]] [[Oak Items/Magma Stone]] | `1.5x-2x` (Based on level) |
| [[File:Chople.png\|24px]] [[Berries/Chople]] Berry Aura | `1.03x` per ripe plant. (See [Farm Setups for Egg Step Gain](#!Farm/Setups#eggsteps) for how to obtain up to `2.9x` across the Farm). |
| [[File:Red_Flute.png\|24px]] [[Items/Red Flute]] | Variable based on Flute bonus `[1.02 + .02 * AchievementBonus]x`. Current maximum of `1.2x`. |

## Tips for Breeding {#tips}
#### Breeding Efficiency (BE) {#breedingefficiency}
*For a breakdown of stats and what affects them, see [Pokémon](#!Pokémon#stats).*

A useful stat is a Pokémon's [Breeding Efficiency](#!Pokémon#stats) (BE), which is the amount of attack the Pokémon gains per 40 egg steps. It is a ratio of its attack bonus to its egg steps, in addition to any attack modifiers it has from [EV Bonus](#!Pokérus), [Shadow](#!Shadow_Pokémon) states, and attack-increasing held items. Attack bonus and egg steps can be modified using [[Vitamins]].

In other words, a Pokémon with higher breeding efficiency gains more attack comparatively for the amount of time it takes to hatch them.




#### What to Breed {#whattobreed}
Deciding what Pokémon is most useful to breed depends on your current goals.
* Breeding anything is better than having the Hatchery idle, as it will always increase your overall attack.
* If you wish to do more damage in a specific [Region](#!Regions), breeding Pokémon native to that region may be more efficient as they are not affected by the [Regional Debuff](#Regions#debuff). *A setting in the Hatchery allows you to calculate BE that takes regional debuffs into account.*
* If you wish to do more damage to a specific type, especially for tough gyms or quest line battles, breed Pokémon of an advantageous type with high BE to overcome those battles.
* If you wish to breed for long-term outcomes to meet any kind of battle, breed Pokémon with high BE in a variety of types, so that your damage output is stable against many types matchups.
