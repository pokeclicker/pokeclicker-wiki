Regions are areas in the world of Pokémon. Each new region introduces a new set of [[Routes]], [[Towns]], [[Gyms]] and [[Pokémon]] and many introduce unique gameplay elements.

## Region Mechanics{#mechanics}

#### Docks (Moving from Region to Region) {#docks}
To visit another region, you must first unlock the **dock** in the region that you are in. When you move to a new region, as you will **not** be able to revisit past regions until reaching a dock in the new region.

Docks in subregions are located in the first town you visit and are automatically unlocked.

#### Unlocking New Regions {#unlock}
Unlocking new regions requires defeating the region's League Champion and, if the Pokédex [Challenge Mode](#!Challenge_Modes) is enabled, catching all the Pokémon in the region's Pokédex. Once you become Champion, all missing regional Pokémon will automatically show up in your Pokédex.

**With every region unlocked:**
- Your Pokémon can use 5 more [[Vitamins]].
- You gain more [[Hatchery]] queue slots.

#### Regional Debuff (Challenge Mode){#debuff}
The Regional Debuff is one of two recommended [[Challenge Modes]] for all players.

[[Pokémon]] that are not native to a region receive a damage debuff when battling in that region. The regional debuff cuts Pokémon's attack by 100%, reduced by 10% per region visited. This **debuff percentage** is the same amount for all non-native Pokémon and is strictly based on your highest-reached region, not the region you are currently in nor the native region of the Pokémon.

This means:
- **After unlocking Johto**, Kanto-native Pokémon have their attack reduced by 80% when battling in Johto and Johto-native Pokémon have their attack reduced by 80% when battling in Kanto.
- **After unlocking Hoenn,** Kanto and Johto-native Pokémon have their attack reduced by 70% when battling in Hoenn, Kanto and Hoenn-native Pokémon have their attack reduced by 70% in Johto, and Johto and Hoenn-native Pokémon have their attack reduced by 70% in Kanto.
- **After unlocking Sinnoh,** the damage reduction becomes 60%. **After unlocking Unova,** it becomes 50%, and so on.

As new regions are reached, the regional debuff decreases and this penalty becomes less notable.

#### Dungeon Debuff {#dungeondebuff}
*→ See: [Dungeons/Regional Debuff](#!Dungeons#debuff)*

Dungeons in regions that are 3 or more regions below your highest region receive a debuff to Epic, Legendary, and Mythic loot drop rates.
