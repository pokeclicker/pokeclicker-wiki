Amaze mulch increases the growth and mutation rates by 25% (1.25x) and the harvest rate and replant chance by 50% (1.5x).  Each amaze mulch lasts for 5 minutes (300 seconds), and they can be stacked for a longer effect time.
These effects stack with the effects of the ([[Oak_Items/Sprayduck]]), ([[Oak_Items/Sprinklotad]]), and ([[Oak_Items/Squirtbottle]]) Oak Items.

If you are wanting to achieve a specific effect, ([[Items/Boost Mulch]]) gives a stronger growth boost (50%), ([[Items/Surprise Mulch]]) gives a higher mutation boost (50%), and  ([[Items/Rich Mulch]]) gives a higher harvest boost, and each of these costs fewer [[Farm Points]] than Amaze Mulch.
