## Statistics

Pokémon performance is defined by some statistics based on their main games values as described here

### Base attack

The formula for a Pokemon’s Base Attack is loosely derived from Pokemon Go’s formula for CP. It can be described through the following equations:

Base offense = 2 \* [√(Atk\*SAtack) + √Spe]
Base defense = 2 \* [√(Def\*SDef) + √Spe]
Base stamina = 2 \* HP
Base attack = √(Base Defense \* Base stamina) \* (Base offense/250)
* When this value is \<10 then 10 is applied instead.
* This value is floored.
*this formula mean that all pokemon stats contribute to the pokemon attack, but not in the same amount. HP and attack values are more significant than Def or speed.*

#### Attack

When first caught, a Pokemon will at level 100 have an Attack stat equal to their Base Attack. Beneath level 100, their Attack scales linearly from 0 to their maximum Attack. However, at no point may a Pokemon’s Attack be less than 1.

The total Pokémon attack will increase as while breeding according to the attack bonus.

##### Attack Bonus

The attack bonus is the extra damage a Pokémon get in each breeding. This is **always** calculated using the base attack, not the current attack.
The **base** Attack bonus is A **25%** of their base attack.
*Example: metapod, that have a 20 base attack will have an attack bonus of 5. After 1 hatch it's total attack will be 25, after 2 hatches it will be 30 and after 10 hatches it will be 70.*

The **Attack bonus** Can be increased using 2 different @[[Vitamins]] protein and calcium:
* **Proteins** gives 1+ attack bonus. *In our example metapod will have 6 attack bonus after use 1 protein and 15 attack bonus after use 10 proteins. While Pidgeot (with 112 base attack) Will have 29 attack bonus after 1 protein and 38 after 10 proteins*
* **Calcium** gives 1% of base attack as attack bonus. *Un our example metapod will have 5,2 attack bonus after 1 calcium and 7 attack bonus after 10 calcium. While Pidgeot will have 29,12 attack bonus after 1 calcium and 39,2 after 10 calcium*

### Egg Steps

Egg Steps Is the value that determinantes how long it will take for an egg to open. Routes gives different values of egg steps depending on their difficulty. Egg steps are agruped in egg cycles (1 egg cycle = 40 egg steps)

The egg cycle value for each species begins with the canonical value, with alternate forms using the same value as the base form, and is subject to few modifiers:

* An evolved Pokemon’s egg cycle value is 1.5 times the egg cycle value of their pre-evolved form. In the case of third-stage Pokemon, their egg cycle value is 1.5 times the egg cycle value of the second-stage Pokemon
* A baby Pokemon’s egg cycle value is 0.8 times the egg cycle value of the base species
There is a hard cap of 120 egg cycles, equaling 4800 steps, after all factors have been accounted for

There are exceptions to this rule:

* The egg cycle values for Sand Cloak and Trash Cloak forms of Burmy and Wormadam are 1.5x higher than their Plant Cloak counterparts, since Burmy (plant) evolves into Burmy (sand) and Burmy (trash).
* Cherrim (sunshine) has 1.5x the egg cycle value of Cherrim (overcast)
