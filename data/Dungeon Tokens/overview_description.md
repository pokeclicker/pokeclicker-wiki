Dungeon Tokens [[File:dungeonToken.svg|25px]] are blue tokens earned when a Pokémon is caught. They are consumables that are primarily used as a currency to enter [[Dungeons]].

## Formulas

Dungeon Tokens are obtained via the following formula. Each Dungeon has an associated route that is approximately the same difficulty that is used in this calculation.

$$ \text{Dungeon Tokens} = \max\Bigg( 1, 6 \times \frac{\text{route} \times 2}{\frac{2.8}{1 + \frac{\text{region}}{3}}}\Bigg) \times \text{Achievement Bonus} $$

A rate of Average Dungeon Tokens Gained per Second has been calculated for each route in order to calculate the most efficient routes for Dungeon Token Farming in each region. The formula used to calculate the rates detailed on this page is as follows:

$$ \frac{\text{Dungeon Tokens} \times \text{Average Catch \%}}{\text{Defeat Time} + \text{Catch Time}} $$

**Dungeon Tokens** and **Average Catch%** are route specific constants.
**Defeat Time** represents the time taken to defeat a Pokémon and is a constant (defeat time = 1 second).
**Catch Time** is a ball specific constant.

## Obtaining Dungeon Tokens
The following tables present the relevant information for gaining Dungeon Tokens. The most efficient routes are included in the Optimal Farming Routes table. All route rates are also included below in subsequent tables.
The columns included in each table represent all the various combinations of the four standard Pokéballs and the [[Oak_Items/Magic_Ball]].

:---: | :---:
PB | Just [[Items/Poké_Ball]]
PB + MB | Both [[Items/Poké_Ball]] and [[Oak_Items/Magic_Ball]]
GB | Just [[Items/Great_Ball]]
GB + MB | Both [[Items/Great_Ball]] and [[Oak_Items/Magic_Ball]]
UB | Just [[Items/Ultra_Ball]]
UB + MB | Both [[Items/Ultra_Ball]] and [[Oak_Items/Magic_Ball]]

Importantly, the following tables assume two things:

1. You can defeat these routes in 1-shot
2. You have the Magic Ball at max level (5)

If either of these conditions is not met, it is possible that the most efficient route will not be the one listed in the table and that rates of Average Dungeon Tokens Gained per Second may be diminished.
