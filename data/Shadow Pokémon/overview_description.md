Shadow Pokémon are Pokémon with a shadowy aura that can be encountered in Orre, a subregion from [[Regions/Hoenn]]. They can only be encountered as part of a trainer battle and never as a wild encounter.

These Pokémon have a **0.8x** multiplier to its attack. However, they can be purified which will change the multiplier to **1.2x** instead, making Purified Pokémon stronger than a regular one.

To purify a Shadow Pokémon, the player needs to gain Flow. **1 Flow** is gained every **1,000 experience points** the Shadow and Purified Pokémon gain. Once enough Flow is acquired, purification can be done in [[Towns/Relic Stone]] in Orre. The Flow that is needed to purify a Shadow Pokémon increases with each purification and it follows this formula:

$Flow = [10 * Purified^2 + 10 * Purified + 1000 * e^{(0.1 * Purified)}]$

Shadow Pokémon can also equip special Held Items that boost experience gain called Scents. Currently, there are three Scents in the game: [[Items/Joy Scent]], [[Items/Vivid Scent]], and [[Items/Excite Scent]]. Once purified, however, the Pokémon will lose these equipped Held Items.
