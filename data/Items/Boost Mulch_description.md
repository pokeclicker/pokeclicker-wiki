Boost mulch increases the growth and wither rate of berries by 50% (1.5x) for the duration of the item's effect.  Each rich mulch lasts for five minutes (300 seconds), and they can be stacked for a longer boost time.  This effect stacks with the effect of the [[Sprayduck]] Oak Item

Every boost mulch removes 2.5 minutes (150 seconds) from the final growth time.
