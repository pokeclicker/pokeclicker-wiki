The first eight berries are dropped by wild pokemon or looted from chests in [[Dungeons]]. Berries can then be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farm Points]] and multiply, used to attract [[Wandering Pokémon]], or provide special bonuses via [auras](#aura).  Collected berries can be traded for specialty [[Poké Balls]], [[Vitamins]], and other Evolution Items at [[Berry Masters]] shops and spent to evolve [[Pokemon/Milcery]] into Alcremies at the [[Battle Cafe]].  While common berries drop as loot from wild Pokémon, but most require setting up specific layouts on the Farm and getting a lucky [mutation](#mutation) to a new species.

## Features
### Related Items{#item}

The [[Oak Items/Sprayduck]], [[Oak Items/Squirtbottle]], and [[Oak Items/Sprinklotad]] are all [[Oak Items]] that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.  Mulches ([[Items/Amaze Mulch]], [[Items/Boost Mulch]], [[Items/Freeze Mulch]], [[Items/Gooey Mulch]] [[Items/Rich Mulch]] or [[Items/Surprise Mulch]]) can be applied to berries for various effects, increasing yield, affecting growth or attracting more rare Wanderers.  [[Items/Berry Shovel]] will remove and destroy any planted berry.

### Wanderers{#wanderer}

Farms with at least one ripe Berry can attract [[Wandering Pokémon]]. Some Berries can attract rare Pokémon and can thus be used strategically to complete the Pokédex. Wandering Pokémon can also be shiny, capturing shiny Wandering Pokémon when the Farm has at least one empty plot is the condition for a Starf Berry to spawn on the Farm (in one of the empty plots).

## Mutations{#mutation}

 Every berry that isn't a wild Pokémon drop can generated through **mutation**, though many of the early mutations also appear in later regions as [dungeon loot](#!Dungeons#chest).  Each new berry requires specific conditions to mutate, usually two or more fully mature berries adjacent to an empty plot. Adjacencies are checked orthogonally (north, south, east, west) and diagonally (NE, SE, NW, SW).  The second and rarer case is when berries mutate by evolving in the proper conditions. There are also some Berries with unique generation such as the [[Berries/Kasib]] and [[Berries/Starf]] Berries, that are explained on their individual Berry pages.

Mutation chance varies wildly between different berries.  For a standard mutation to occur, all the required berries must be ripe on the farm simultaneously. When this is true, the game will check each eligible empty plot once a second to see if a mutation happens. If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously for a given farm plot, the mutation triggered will be selected at random, with weighted distribution based on mutation chance.

Individual berry pages have Optimized Planting Formations to maximize the chances of a mutation occurring, as well as a Timing Chart to help plant berries at the correct times, such that all of them will become ripe simultaneously.  Mutation chance can be increased by using the Oak Item [[Items/Squirtbottle]] and/or consumable [[Items/Surprise Mulch]].

The Kanto Berry Master in [[Towns/Cerulean City]] will give a hint daily for berries the player hasn't yet acquired.  Green dots appear on Farm plots after setting up the parent plants, showing they are eligible to create a known mutation.

_If you have not yet unlocked all the plots on the Farm and need to mutate berries #9 Persim through #25 Grepa, please use the [Walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TE5cAKSlA7TAliA001_mIiO1odZ6e4yUEMre0GBW1to/edit?usp=sharing)  link for an optimized planting formation to mutate those berries within the limited available farm plots._

### Growth Mutations{#growth}

Most Berries mutate by appearing in an empty plot that has all the required berries fully grown in one or more adjacent plots. Growth mutations do not occur where there is already a berry growing.  These are the simplest type of mutation and make up the majority of mutated Berry types.

_Example: Persim has a mutation rate of 2%. This means each second the required berries (Oran and Pecha) are ripe on the Farm in the proper locations to cause a mutation to occur, there is a 2% chance of mutating a Persim, per plot. Following the Optimized Planting Formation for Persim, there are at least 5 possible plots for Persim to mutate on, that means that each second the game calculates whether the 2% chance occurred 5 separate times. The Pecha berry will only remain ripe for 1 minute, thus if both Pecha berries become ripe at the same time as Oran, each plot will calculate to see if a mutation will occur 60 times, or in other words, there are 300 chances with a 2% mutation before the Pechas wither and must be replanted and a 99.77% chance of getting at least one Persim before that happens._

### Evolution Mutations{#evolve}

Berries that mutate by evolving will **replace** an existing berry with the newly mutated berry.  Evolutions can be triggered by meeting the berry's conditional requirement, which might involve equipping certain [[Oak Items]], a specific [[Farm]] state, or a certain nearby host plant.  Some of these are called parasite berries, because they take over other berries to duplicate themselves indiscriminately.  Parasite berries have "It has a tendency to overtake nearby plants" in their BerryDex descriptions, and can only trigger on a different species than their own.

All evolution mutations can only occur while the berries are in the Taller or older growth stages, rather than only when Ripe the way growth mutations do.  For mutations involving flavor requirements, all berries emit flavor points beginning at the Taller stage (berries have 0.5x flavor in the Taller stage, 0.75x flavor in the Bloom stage, and 1x flavor in the Berry stage).

### Setups{#setup}

Thanks to certain Berries having helpful auras, it's possible to use them to achieve different goals. These Setups can be found in:
- [[Hatchery]]: Setups related to Egg Step gain
- [[Shiny Chance]]: Setups related to increasing Shiny Chance
- [[Pokérus]]: Setups related to increasing EV Yield
- [[Farm/Setups]]: Setups not contained in the previous two pages
