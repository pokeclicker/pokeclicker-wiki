There are a number of Farming Setups not related to [Breeding Pokemon faster](#!Hatchery/ "Hatchery") or  [Increasing Shiny Chance](https://pokeclicker.miraheze.org/wiki/Shiny_Chance "Shiny Chance")  that are quite useful, particularly when either mutating berries or trying to harvest mutated berries faster, or, even without mutating berries, if you just want to harvest a lot of berries to trade to the  [Berry Master](https://pokeclicker.miraheze.org/wiki/Berry_Master "Berry Master").
Here are some useful berry setups to know.

_Note: Aura Received is multiplicative from all the auras affecting a berry. If a Berry receives the aura from 4 aura berries each at 1.3x aura output, that Berry receives 1.3^4 = 2.8561, or ~2.86x as an aura multiplier. If a Berry receives auras from 3 berries, two at 1.3x and one at 1.2x, the berry receives 1.3^2 * 1.2x = 2.028, or ~2.03x aura output_

## Growth Aura Setups
Blue squares show Boost Mulch being recommended. If you are ready to harvest the boosted berry use Rich Mulch for maximum harvesting gain.

- _Tip: Once a berry has grown enough using [[Berries/Wacan]]'s Boost Aura, swap the Wacans for [[Berries/Passho]] berries to gain maximum Berry Harvests._

### Wacan
Below is the base setup to give a massive aura boost to a central berry on the farm. The [[Berries/Petaya]] is only being used as an example in this case.
While Wacan is used here, it can be swapped out for Passho to gain more berries per harvest.
Don't forget to add the appropriate Mulch!

### Wacan + 4 Lum
This is the ideal single berry setup, with the target berry in the central plot receiving the maximum possible Growth Aura boost of 10.33x.

## Harvest Aura Setups
These setups are the most efficient setups for harvesting the greatest amount of berries.
_Green Squares indicate which squares to apply [[Rich Mulch]] to._

### Passho
This is the setup for harvesting the maximum amount of berries from any berry with a harvest amount of 1 or greater.
The setup gives you 6 plots at 4.83x harvest rate, and 4 plots at 2.86x harvest rate.

- Example: Using this setup, growing and harvesting 10 [[Berries/Aguav]] berries while all the Passho berries are ripe will yield 684 Aguav berries (1,372 with Rich Mulch) per harvesting cycle. In comparison, growing and harvesting 25 Aguav berries without any Passho berries would yield 425 Aguav berries (850 with Rich mulch) per harvesting cycle. Using Farmhand Jessie with the [[Sprayduck]] equipped to repeatedly harvest Aguav berries every 4 minutes would yield 40,356 berries (80,948 with Rich Mulch) for the duration of the Passho berries' ripe phase.

### Passho + Petaya
This setup yield slightly fewer berries per harvesting cycle, in exchange for vastly increased Passho ripeness time.

- Example: Despite the Petaya berry taking a slot away from a Passho berry, growing 10 Aguav berries would still yield 654 Aguav berries per harvesting cycle (1,311 with Rich Mulch). However, the Petaya berry will keep all Passho berries ripe for at least 64 hours. Farmhand Jessie could harvest 618,240 Aguav berries (harvesting in 4 minute cycles) over this time.

You can also simply replace a Passho in one of the corners with a 2nd Petaya. When the first Petaya's wither time is getting close to the growth time of a Petaya minus the wither time of a Passho (10 hours with just Sprayduck equipped, ~6 hours 40 minutes if you use [[Boost Mulch]] on the 2nd Petaya as well as having the Sprayduck equipped).
When timed correctly, you can harvest the near-death Petaya and replace it with another Passho Berry to keep this formation up indefinitely.

## Growth and Harvest Aura Setup (Wacan + Passho Handoff)
Combining the Wacan and Passho setups is incredibly useful when trying to quickly grow and harvest multiple Gen 5 berries that have a base 0.5 berry harvest yield, such as Starf or Petaya. This two-part setup, going from the Wacan formation to the following Passho formation, is the most efficient way to harvest more of these berries in the shortest amount of time.

Using Farmhands Jessie or Riley to either: harvest and replant Wacans, or just replant Wacans as they wither (which is faster, but requires actively watching out for Kasib mutations on withered plots) is the best way to cultivate slow growing Gen 5 berries in a reasonable amount of time.
Due to the very low harvest amount, completely surrounding each Berry with 8 Passho berries is the best way to maximize harvest amounts.

For maximum efficiency you should swap from the Wacan formation to the Passho formation before the Gen 5 berries are ripe.
It takes a little bit of math to perform this swap correctly due to the Wacan Growth aura variably affecting the Gen 5 berries depending on what stage the Wacan berries are in, but if you multiply the shown 'Time until Ripe' by the 'Aura Received' you get how much longer the Gen 5 berry has until it would be ripe without the Wacan berries' effect.
Since it takes some time for the Passho berries to grow, first calculate the actual time until ripe (without modifiers), and then harvest every Wacan berry when the Gen 5 berry has less time until it's ripe than it will take the Passho to ripen (including any growth multipliers ([[Sprayduck]],  [[Boost Mulch]]) you're using on the Passho berries).

Make sure to apply [[Rich Mulch]] before harvesting the Gen 5 berries!
Using this strategy will yield 32 (28 cumulative) Gen 5 berries harvested per cycle.

## Wandering Pokémon Setups
[[Wandering Pokémon]] are attracted to ripe berries. For the maximum chance of attracting a desired wandering Pokémon, use one of the setups below.

### Roseli + Lum + Attracting Berry
Using a single Sum berry surrounded by 7 Roseli berries, and then filling the remainder of open farm spots with an attracting berry (a berry that attracts a particular species of wandering Pokémon) is the most effective way of attracting wandering Pokémon to the farm.
- _Note: Do not use this setup with [[Berries/Occa]], [[Berries/Colbur]], or [[Berries/Kebia]] berries. Due to their nature of overtaking other berries, it is most efficient to simply plant 25 of those berries._

### Roseli + Lum + Petaya + Attracting Berry
For a significantly longer uptime than the above setup to attract a wandering Pokémon - perhaps if you're looking for a specific Pokémon or group of Pokémon to turn shiny for example - replace a Roseli berry with a Petaya berry.
This doesn't decrease the encounter chance per second significantly, but it does make this setup viable for several days instead of several hours.

## Regaining Lost Gen 5 Berries
Shoveled your only copy of a Gen 5 berry by accident? You can use [[Berries/Enigma]] berries to mutate another rather than having to go through the original mutation process.
Here is the setup you need to mutate a Petaya berry if you shovel your only one by accident.
- _Note: Don't forget to equip the [[Squirtbottle]], and use [[Surprise Mulch]] as this is a mutation. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur._

## Squirtbottle Leveling Strategies
Here are a few highly efficient strategies on how to level up the Squirtbottle based on which berries you have unlocked.

### Occa/Kebia Planting Formation
If you want to be able to gain experience more passively, then the best strategy is with Occa and Kebia berries. Colbur works for this as well, but takes longer enough to grow that it isn't as useful. This strategy will likely let you level up your Squirtbottle from 0 to 5 without having to set it up again unless you get unlucky with a full takeover.
- _Note: When using this strategy, make sure to plant the berries so that they ripen at the same time to lower the chance of full takeover._

### Sitrus/Kebia Planting Formation
If you only have Kebia berries and neither of the other two, you can use Kebia and Sitrus at the same time in the following formation.
- _Note: This will need to be set up every 20 minutes since both berries take 10 minutes to ripen, but you don't need to check on it more often than that._

### Persim Planting Formation
Another common strategy involves mutating [[Berries/Persim]] berries if you haven't unlocked Occa, Kebia, or Colbur yet.
You can find the formation and timings on the [[Berries/Persim]] page.
This is a very active strategy, but this setup should provide a little over 3.58 mutations on average including time waiting for growth.
This strategy is also the fastest, but needs at least about 4 and a half hours of active growth and mutation time to complete.

## Sprinklotad Leveling Strategy
The most efficient way to gain experience for the [[Sprinklotad]] is to equip the fully-leveled Sprayduck and surround 4 Kasib berries with Cheri berries in the following way. Keep replanting Cheris as they wither while either shoveling or harvesting extra Kasibs that may sprout.
