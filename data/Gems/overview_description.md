Gems are dropped when defeating Pokémon. They are used to permanently upgrade the attack effectiveness of party Pokémon of that type. Gems are also traded at [[Shops]] and used to power [[Flutes]].

Gems are unlocked by obtaining the [Gem Case](#!Key_Items) after defeating [Giovanni's Gym](#!Towns/Viridian_City) in Viridian City.

## Obtaining Gems {#obtaining}
#### Defeating Pokémon
The type(s) of Gems dropped will match type(s) of the defeated Pokémon. For dual-type Pokémon, half of the Gem drop amount will be one type and half will be the other.

The amount of Gems dropped varies based on location, listed in the chart below. Individual [Gem pages](#wiki-page-content) have a list of the best farming locations. In general, [[Gyms]] are the most efficient way to obtain Gems of a specific type.

Location | Total Gems Dropped
:--- | :---
Route Pokémon |  2
Dungeon Pokémon (Pokémon and Trainer encounters) | 6
Gym Pokémon | 10
Dungeon Bosses (Pokémon encounters only) | 40
Battle Frontier | Variable (See [[Battle Frontier]])


#### Plates {.mt-3}
Plates can be exchanged for Gems in the [[Underground]] module. Each Plate can be sold for 100 Gems of the same type.

## Upgrading Type Effectiveness {#attacktype}
Type effectiveness upgrades can be found in **Start > Gems**. Each type is split into four categories, based on how effective the type is against opponent types. Each upgrade increases attack done by **all** party Pokémon of that type by 10% in battles against opponents in that category.

It costs **27,500** Gems to fully upgrade a category.

| Level {.col-1}| Gem Price {.col-1}| Attack vs. Immune {.col-1}| Attack vs. Not Very Effective {.col-1}| Attack vs. Neutral {.col-1}| Attack vs. Very Effective {.col-1} |
| :---- | :-------- | :----- | :----- | :----- |:----- |
| 0     | -         | 0%     | 50%    | 100%   | 200%  |
| 1     | 500       | 10%    | 60%    | 110%   | 210%  |
| 2     | 1,000     | 20%    | 70%    | 120%   | 220%  |
| 3     | 1,500     | 30%    | 80%    | 130%   | 230%  |
| 4     | 2,000     | 40%    | 90%    | 140%   | 240%  |
| 5     | 2,500     | 50%    | 100%   | 150%   | 250%  |
| 6     | 3,000     | 60%    | 110%   | 160%   | 260%  |
| 7     | 3,500     | 70%    | 120%   | 170%   | 270%  |
| 8     | 4,000     | 80%    | 130%   | 180%   | 280%  |
| 9     | 4,500     | 90%    | 140%   | 190%   | 290%  |
| 10    | 5,000     | 100%   | 150%   | 200%   | 300%  |

#### Tips for Upgrading {.mt-3}
- It is recommended to put at least one upgrade into Immune for each type, so that these Pokémon can start dealing damage to Immune types.
- You may want to prioritize upgrading categories that have the most types or most difficult matchups. Check your current party damage by type using the Damage Calculator under the Start menu.
