Berries can be grown in the Farm to earn Farm Points. You can trade certain berries for Masterballs, Protein, and other Evolution Items at Berry Master shops.

### Features
#### Related Oak Items

The [[Oak Items/Sprayduck]], [[Oak Items/Squirtbottle]], and [[Oak Items/Sprinklotad]] are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

#### Wanderers

Farms with at least one ripe Berry can attract [[Wandering Pokémon]]. Some Berries can attract rare Pokémon and can thus be used strategically to complete the Pokédex. Wandering Pokémon can also be shiny, capturing shiny Wandering Pokémon when the Farm has at least one empty plot is the condition for a Starf Berry to spawn on the Farm (in one of the empty plots).

### Mutations

The first 10 berries are found in routes or dungeons, but after that the player needs to generate new berries through **mutation**. Each berry requires specific conditions to be able to mutate. The Kanto Berry Master (Cerulean City) will give a different hint daily for berry mutations.

Most berry mutations happen at the Berry (fully ripe) stage and have a chance to occur until they die. Evolution *(a berry transforming into another)* and flavor mutations can occur starting at the Taller stage. For mutations involving flavor requirements, all berries emit flavor points beginning at the Taller stage (berries have 0.5x flavor in the Taller stage, 0.75x flavor in the Bloom stage, and 1x flavor in the Berry stage).

If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be selected at random.

[Here is a Walkthrough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TE5cAKSlA7TAliA001_mIiO1odZ6e4yUEMre0GBW1to/edit) for unlocking all of the Farm Slots in order.

### Setups
Thanks to certain Berries having helpful auras, it's possible to use them to achieve different goals. These Setups can be found in:
- [[Hatchery]]: Setups related to Egg Step gain.
- [[Shiny Chance]]: Setups related to increasing Shiny Chance.
- [[Farm/Setups]]: Setups not contained in the previous two pages, like EV gain, or formations to speed up experience gain for the Farm Oak Items.
