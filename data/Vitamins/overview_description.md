Vitamins are items that can be purchased at the Pokémon League in any region. Vitamins can be given to Pokémon to adjust their stats, which affects their breeding efficiency. **Protein** is available in [[Regions/Kanto]], **Calcium** is unlocked upon reaching [[Regions/Hoenn]], and **Carbos** is unlocked upon reaching [[Regions/Unova]].

## How to Use
Go to `Start Menu` → `Items` → `Item Bag`, select the vitamin and select a Pokémon to use it on.

**Limitations:**
- Vitamins cannot be added to Pokémon that are currently in the [[Hatchery]].
- Each Pokémon can consume up to a total of 5 vitamins per unlocked region (a current maximum of 40, after unlocking Galar).

Vitamins are not consumable and can be added and removed, as needed. To remove, right click the Pokémon or toggle the give/take button.

Each Pokémon page has a table with the highest breeding efficiency vitamin distributions, based on the highest unlocked region.

## Price
When bought from the Pokémon League shop, the price for vitamins rises **permanently**, similar to Master Balls. Prices increment by 1.1x every purchase, and caps at 100x the base price (after 49 purchases).
