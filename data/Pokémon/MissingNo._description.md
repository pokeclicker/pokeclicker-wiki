**MissingNo. is not currently obtainable by legitimate means in the game.**
There are some legitimate cases where MissingNo. may have been obtained, but these only happen when there is a bug somewhere in the code.
As such it is currently mostly used as a debug Pokémon for the developers.

*If you find this Pokémon report it through [GitHub](https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/a6DFe4p) as you might find a bug that can be dangerous.*
