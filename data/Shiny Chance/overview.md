Shiny is a rare [[Pokémon]] state that can randomly occur in encounters, when hatching, evolving, or obtaining Pokémon.

The shiny status of Pokémon in your party **does not** affect any stats or modifiers. The number of shiny Pokémon you own contributes toward [[Click Attack]] and various [[Achievements]].

There are some benefits when encountering or obtaining a **new or duplicate** shiny Pokémon:
- Shiny Pokémon encounters have a 100% drop rate for their [[Rare Hold Item]].
- Catching a shiny Pokémon provides a 5x multiplier to their [EV yield](#!Pokérus).
- A [hatch](#!Hatchery) that results in a shiny Pokémon grants 5x attack gain.

## Tips for Obtaining Shiny Pokémon {#tips}
- [Breeding](#!Hatchery) is the most efficient way to obtain Shiny Pokémon, due to its relatively high shiny rate and many methods for breeding faster. This is also why most [Farm Setups for Shiny Chance](#!Farm/Setups#shiny) involve increasing Egg Step gain.
- [[Oak Items/Shiny Charm]] is levelled by encountering Shiny Pokémon (you do not have to successfully catch them). Thus, you may want to use it even while not shiny hunting in order to level the item.
