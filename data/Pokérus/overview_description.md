## Description

Pokérus is a microscopic life-form that can attach to Pokémon. Your Kanto Starter Pokémon will automatically be infected with Pokérus after completing [[Quest Lines/A New World]] Quest Line in Sinnoh. Pokérus is a beneficial virus to any Pokémon that catches it. Once a Pokémon is infected by the Pokérus, it may gain **Effort Values (EVs)**, which multiplicatively increase the attack of that Pokémon via the EV Damage Multiplier.
