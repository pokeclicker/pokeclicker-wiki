## Leveling Strategies
Here are a few highly efficient strategies on how to level up the Squirtbottle based on which berries you have unlocked.

### Occa/Kebia Planting Formation (a.k.a. Berry Wars)
If you want to be able to gain experience more passively, then the best strategy is with Occa and Kebia berries. Colbur works for this as well, but takes longer enough to grow that it isn't as useful. This strategy will likely let you level up your Squirtbottle from 0 to 5 without having to set it up again unless you get unlucky with a full takeover.
- _Note: When using this strategy, make sure to plant the berries so that they ripen at the same time, so planting Kebia Berries when Occa has 10 minutes left till ripen; to lower the chance of full takeover._

### Sitrus/Kebia Planting Formation
If you only have Kebia berries and neither of the other two, you can use Kebia and Sitrus at the same time in the following formation.
- _Note: This will need to be set up every 20 minutes since both berries take 10 minutes to ripen, but you don't need to check on it more often than that._

### Persim Planting Formation
Another common strategy involves mutating [[Berries/Persim]] berries if you haven't unlocked Occa, Kebia, or Colbur yet.
You can find the formation and timings on the [[Berries/Persim]] page.
This is a very active strategy, but this setup should provide a little over 3.58 mutations on average including time waiting for growth.
This strategy is also the fastest, but needs at least about 4 and a half hours of active growth and mutation time to complete.
