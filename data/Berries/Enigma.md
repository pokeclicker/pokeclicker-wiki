## Mutation Strategy {#mutation}

### Possible Planting Formations {#planting}

Enigma can be obtained by getting 4 different hints from the Kanto Berry Master and surrounding an empty plot with berries according to those hints. Enigma hints contain a cardinal direction and a berry. If the hint does not have a cardinal direction, then it's **not** an Enigma hint and it's instead a hint from a berry the player hasn't unlocked yet. These hints depend on the Trainer ID, so each profile will have a different Enigma configuration.

You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Enigma Berries. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.

## Possible Hints
Due to inconvenience, some berries cannot be selected as hints. Any Gen 3 or 4 berry can be selected, except the following:

* Parasitic berries ([[File:Occa.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Occa]], [[File:Kebia.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Kebia]] or [[File:Colbur.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Colbur]])
* Berries that prevent mutation ([[File:Babiri.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Babiri]])

Here is a list of berries that can be given as hints:

## Additional Mutations
Planting Enigma berries next to certain other berries will cause them to mutate. For all of these mutations, the goal berry must already be unlocked for the mutation to occur. Each berry has a 0.04% chance of mutation.
