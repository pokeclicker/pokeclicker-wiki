Hatchery Helpers are people that can be hired to work on your Pokémon Day Care to automate the [[Hatchery]].
Many can be unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements, while others can be purchased from certain Shops.
Once hired, a Hatchery Helper will work until they are fired or you do not have the necessary funds to continue to employ them.
