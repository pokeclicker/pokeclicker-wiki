## Berry Auras {#aura}
Some berries have special auras that can affect gameplay or other plots on the farm. Auras can be extremely beneficial, helping players find shiny Pokémon at higher rates or breed more efficiently or increase harvest yields. Auras can also have negative effects.

Berry plants can begin emitting auras at the Taller stage, but some auras are only available on fully Ripe plants. Most auras that affect other plots on the farm only affect adjacent plots (i.e. the surrounding 8 plots) and can stack. Exceptions are noted below.

For useful Farm Setups using auras, see [[Farm/Setups]].
