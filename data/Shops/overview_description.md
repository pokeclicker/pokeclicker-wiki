Shops are locations in [[Towns]] where you can purchase and trade for [[Items]] and [[Pokémon]].

## Prices {#shopprices}
Most items that are purchased with currency (e.g. Pokédollars, Quest Points) increase in price when bought. The price will decrease after defeating Pokémon on Routes, Gyms, and Dungeons, until it reaches its base price. Trades that involve items and gems never increase in price.

Exceptions:
- [[Items/Poké Ball]] never increases in price.
- [[Items/Master Ball]], [[Vitamins]], and [[Items/Key Stone]] increase in price permanently (up to a cap).


:::collapsed Price Change Formulas
With each item purchased, the price increases based on this formula (rounded):

$\text{Total Price} =  Price \times \large\frac{1-1.00045^{Items Purchased}}{1-1.00045}${.overflow-auto .text-center}

Each time you defeat a Pokémon, the price decreases (to its base price), based on this formula:

$\text{New Reduced Price} =  \large\frac{\text{Item Price}}{1.00045}${.overflow-auto .text-center}
