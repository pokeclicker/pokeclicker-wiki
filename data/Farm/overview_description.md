In the Farm, you can grow different types of [[Berries]], which can be traded for useful items and unique Pokémon and earn you [[Farm Points]] [[File:farmPoint.svg|25px]]. Berry plants also attract Wandering Pokémon, create helpful auras, and more.

The Farm is unlocked after reaching [[Routes/Kanto Route 11]] and obtaining the [Wailmer Pail](#!Key_Items).

## Growing Berries {#growing}
*See also: [[Berries]]. For a breakdown of harvest yields, flavors, and mutation configurations, visit each Berry's individual page. In-game, this information can be found in the Berrydex Tab.*

#### Acquiring Berries
The first eight Gen 1 Berries are dropped by wild Pokémon. More Berries can be found in dungeon chests and later regions, but most Berries will be unlocked via [mutation](!#Berries#mutation).

#### Planting Berries
Plant berries by selecting the desired berry in the left-hand column and clicking on plots in the field on the right. Alternatively, **Plant All**{.btn .btn-dark .btn-sm .disabled} can be clicked to plant the selected Berry in every empty plot. Different Berries have different growth times, which can be modified by mulch, auras, and [[Oak Items/Sprayduck]]. Berry plants grow in **four stages** (Sprout → Taller → Bloom → Ripe).

#### Harvesting Berries
Once ripe, Berry plants can be harvested by clicking on them. Different Berry types yield different harvest amounts, which can be modified by mulch or auras, and will earn you [[Farm Points]]. ***Note:** Berry plants will always yield at least 1 Berry, even if their harvest amount is less than 1.*

If left unharvested, ripe Berry plants will eventually **wither**, dropping half of the expected Berries. There is also a chance they will **replant** themselves, spawning a plant of the same berry in that plot. Farm Points are not gained when Berries wither or get replanted. Replant rates can be modified by mulch or auras.

#### Mutating Berries
*→ See: [Mutations](#!Berries/#mutations)*

Berries planted in certain configurations can mutate into new Berry species. The Kanto Berry Master in [[Towns/Cerulean City]] gives hints for how to mutate new Berries.

---

## Uses for Berry Plants {#berryuses}
Berry plants can be used for more than just acquiring more Berries and Farm Points.

#### Attracting Wandering Pokémon{#wanderers}
*→ See: [Wandering Pokémon](#!Wandering_Pokémon)*

Ripe Berry plants can attract wild Wandering Pokémon that you can capture. They will appear next to the Berry and remain until interacted with. If the Berry is harvested or withers, the Wanderer will flee after a few minutes. Interacting with a Wanderer earns you Farm Points, whether you catch it or not. Successfully capturing one will also earn you Dungeon Tokens.

#### Berry Auras{#auras}
*→ See: [Auras](#!Berries/#aura)*

Some Berry plants emit special auras at Taller or later stages that can affect gameplay and other plants. Aura effects are shown when hovering over the Berry plant or affected plots.

Guides on useful Farm Setups using auras:
- [[Hatchery]]: Setups related to Egg Step gain
- [[Shiny Chance]]: Setups related to increasing Shiny Chance
- [[Pokérus]]: Setups related to increasing EV Yield
- [[Farm/Setups]]: Setups not contained in the previous two pages

## Farm Plots{#plots}
The Farm starts with one free plot. More farm plots can be purchased using Berries and Farm Points, up to a total of 25 plots.

## Farming Items {#farmitems}

#### Consumable Tools {#farmtools}
Mulch and Shovels can be bought from [[Berry Masters]] in exchange for [[Farm Points]]. Mulches can be applied to plots for various boosts, while Shovels are used to clear occupied plots of unwanted Berries or mulch.

| Name {.col-1}| Price {.col-1}| Description {.col-5}|
|:-------- | :--------: |:--------|
|[[File:Boost_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Boost Mulch]]  | 50 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]] | Increases Berry growth rate by 50% when applied to a plot occupied by a Berry plant. |
|[[File:Rich_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Rich Mulch]]  | 100 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]] | Doubles the amount of berries gained from harvesting a ripe Berry plant. Can be applied immediately prior to harvesting a plant to gain the full doubling boost. Doubles replant chance if berry withers while mulched.  |
|[[File:Surprise_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Surprise Mulch]] | 150 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Increases the chance of Berry mutations by 50% on any plot it is applied to (can be an empty or occupied plot). |
|[[File:Amaze_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Amaze Mulch]] | 200 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Increases the growth and mutation rates by 25% and the harvest rate and replant chance  by 50%.  |
|[[File:Freeze_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Freeze Mulch]] | 350 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Pauses Berry growth and auras. This includes the Colbur berry blocking Kasib berries from mutating, but not parasitic effects since those are strictly a mutation.  |
|[[File:Gooey_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Gooey Mulch]] | 100 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Improves the catch rate of wandering Pokémon on mulched plot by 10%. Also increases the weights of berry or color specific wandering Pokémon, making them more likely to appear.  |
|[[File:Berry_Shovel.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Berry Shovel]] | 300 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Clears a Berry plant of any stage from a plot instantly. (Note: If the Berry plant is at the ripe stage, it will be harvested and the shovel will not be consumed.) |
|[[File:Mulch_Shovel.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Mulch Shovel]] | 300 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Removes Mulch from a plot, regardless of how much time remains. |

## Other Farm Controls {#farmcontrols}
#### Farm Hands {#farmhands}
*→ See: [[Farm Hands]]*

Farm Hands are helpers that can be hired to perform Farming tasks. They can be accessed from the Farm Hands tab of the main Farm window. The first Farm Hand is unlocked after acquiring at least 8 berries.

#### Locking Plots from Interaction {#lockplots}
Farm plots can be locked from interaction to prevent things like unwanted harvesting. Locked plots cannot be planted on, harvested, mulched, or shovelled. Berries on locked plots can still wither, mutate, be over taken by parasite berries, and have Wanderers collected from them. [[Farm Hands]] cannot harvest or plant in locked plots, but will still manage Wanderers if hired to do so.

To lock a plot, click **[[File:farm/plotSafeLock.svg|18px]]**{.btn .btn-dark .btn-sm .disabled} and then click on a plot _or_ hold Shift and click on a plot.

**Lock All**{.btn .btn-dark .btn-sm .disabled} locks all plots, **Unlock All**{.btn .btn-dark .btn-sm  .disabled} unlocks all plots, and **Flip**{.btn .btn-dark .btn-sm .disabled} reverses the locked/unlocked status of all plots.
