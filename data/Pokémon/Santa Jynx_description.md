Santa Jynx spawning follows a scenario on a daily basis, tied to Christmas Presents opened, Christmas event, and Temporary Battles.
A temporary battle appears each day at Bill's House. Defeating it allows the Pokémon to appear with set conditions :
* On day 1, Santa Jynx will spawn until the player collects 10 more presents.
* On day 2, Santa Jynx will spawn until the player collects 15 more presents.
* On day 3, Santa Jynx will spawn until the player collects 21 more presents.
* On day 4 and on, Santa Jynx will spawn until the player collects 100 more presents.
Not collecting the max amount  of presents at the end of a day will cause the same step to repeat on the next day.
