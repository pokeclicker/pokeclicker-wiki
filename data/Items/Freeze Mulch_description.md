Freeze mulch pauses Berry growth and auras.  This includes the Colbur berry blocking Kasib berries from mutating, but not parasitic effects since those are strictly a mutation.  Freeze mulch is useful for keeping berries ripe for longer periods of time to use them for mutations.

Each Freeze mulch lasts for 5 minutes (300 seconds). Multiple freeze mulches can be used for a longer effect time.
