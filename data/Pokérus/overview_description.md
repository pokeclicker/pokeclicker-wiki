Pokérus is a microscopic life-form that can attach to Pokémon. Your Kanto Starter Pokémon (or your lowest ID Pokémon, if your Kanto starter is missing due to Real Evolution challenge or another reason) will automatically be infected with Pokérus after completing [[Quest Lines/A New World]] in Sinnoh.

Once a Pokémon is infected by the Pokérus, it may gain [Effort Values (EVs)](#EV), which multiplicatively increase the attack of that Pokémon.

All Pokémon have at least one method to gain EVs. Check the individual [[Pokémon]]'s page for where and how to acquire them.
