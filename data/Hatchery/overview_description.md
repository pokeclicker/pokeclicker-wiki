The **Pokémon Day Care** is a location in [[Kanto]] where [[Eggs]] and [[Fossils]] can be bred. Additionally, obtained [[Pokémon]] that have reached level 100 can be bred to receive an Attack bonus equal to 25% of its Base Attack.  The Pokémon Day Care is unlocked upon clearing [[Routes/Kanto Route 3]].

One quest that can appear involves hatching a random amount of Eggs. These can be either purchased from [[Shops]], or from breeding level 100 Pokémon.

# Usage

As soon as [[Routes/Kanto Route 3]] is cleared, the Pokémon Day Care can be accessed by clicking on its location on the map on Route 3. Additionally, the Hatchery tab becomes available on the main page.

There are three different types of hatch-able resources in Pokéclicker: obtained Pokémon Eggs, Fossils, and already obtained level 100 Pokémon. Pokémon Eggs are typically purchased in Shops and Fossils are typically mined from the [[Underground]]. The Egg/Fossil/Obtained Pokémon that can be bred each have their own distinct tab in the Pokémon Day Care modal.

Clicking on the desired Egg/Fossil/Level 100 Pokémon will result in it being added to the Hatchery. The Hatchery only has 4 slots, but Breeding Queue slots can be unlocked in each new Region (See Upgrades Below). The Breeding Queue automatically adds queued Pokémon to the Hatchery if there is space. If there is a Pokémon in the queue, Eggs/Fossils that are ready to hatch will do so and be replaced by the queued Pokémon.

Each Pokémon has a certain number of Egg Steps required before it can hatch from an Egg. Consult [[Pokémon]] for egg steps for all Pokémon. Egg Steps are gained through defeating Pokémon. [[Routes]], [[Gyms]], and [[Dungeons]] all yield different numbers of Egg Steps per Pokémon defeated, although the Egg Steps yielded generally scales with the difficulty of the Route, Gym, or Dungeon.

When an Egg/Fossil in the Hatchery has obtained the required number of Egg Steps, as indicated by the green progress bar on each Egg/Fossil, it will be ready to hatch. Clicking on the image of the Egg/Fossil with hatch it, giving the player one of that Pokémon.

Baby Pokémon are Pokémon obtained exclusively through Breeding the evolved stage of that Pokémon. The first time a Baby Pokémon is hatched the player will obtain both the original evolved stage, and the baby stage of that Pokémon.

The 25% increase to a Pokémon's Base Attack through breeding can be increased through the use of [[Protein]]. Proteins increase the Attack bonus from Breeding by 1 for each Protein used on an individual Pokémon. Consult [[Protein]] for further information on Breeding Efficiency using Proteins.

Breeding Pokémon also offers the highest shiny odds in the game (alongside [[Wandering Pokémon]] and [[Shop Pokémon]]) at 1/1024. Consult [[Shiny Chance]] for further information on Shiny Odds using the Hatchery.

[[Hatchery Helpers]] are unlock-able and purchasable [[Items]] that allow the player to automate the hatchery. As of Version 0.9.3 this is a BETA feature and is likely to change in the future.

# Efficiency

There are 3 key aspects to consider when breeding Pokémon towards a specific goal.

#The 'Breeding Efficiency' of that Pokémon (including the number of proteins used on that Pokémon)
#The [[Region]] that Pokémon is found in the Pokédex
#The type of Pokémon you should breed to accomplish that goal

For example, let's say I am trying to defeat Champion Wallace in Hoenn. While the Pokémon with the highest Breeding Efficiency overall is Gyarados, when accounting for the 30% damage debuff for a Kanto Pokémon in the Hoenn region it is merely the 11th most efficient Pokémon to breed. Therefore breeding Azurill, the most efficient Pokémon to breed in Hoenn, will be slightly more efficient overall to defeat Wallace. Furthermore, breeding some of the Hoenn Grass type Pokémon (e.g. Tropius, Breloom, Shroomish, Roselia, etc.) that are only slightly less efficient than Azurill is made up for by their type advantage over Wallace's primarily water type Pokémon. In conclusion, if trying to breed towards a goal focus on high breeding efficiency Pokémon that are from the region you are trying to beat with a type advantage against whatever Pokémon you are struggling to defeat.

# Upgrades

Additional Breeding Queue slots can be obtained by progressing to the next region.

## Hatchery Queue Slots
| Region | Number of Breeding Queue Slots |
|---|---|
| Kanto | 0|
| Johto | 4|
| Hoenn | 8|
| Sinnoh | 16|
| Unova | 32|
| Kalos | 64|
| Alola| 96|
| Galar| 128|

# Farm Strategies

The farm can be utilized to increase the egg steps yielded by Pokémon through the use of [[Chople]] berries. However, as Chople berries surrounded by at least three other Chople berries can mutate into [[Chilan]] berries, specfic strategies must be employed to best plant Chople berries in order to increase egg steps. Below are several strategies that can be used depending on which berries are readily accessible, accompanied by a short description of each strategy's pros and cons as well as a corresponding planting diagram.

Note: Any Strategy that used Petaya will have a slightly different timing table. Once Petaya ripens it resets the timers of all other berries and sets them to infinity. Thus, other berries can be planted so that they ripen before Petaya, and should be timed so that Petaya ripens just before they wither.

## Chople + Empty Rows

The easiest strategy for planting Chople berries is to leave empty rows separating each row of Chople berries. This is easy to do and requires no additional berries, but is also less efficient than other more complex strategies.

## Chople + [[Yache]]/[[Haban]]

A slightly more complex strategy for planting Chople berries is to plant berries that decrease growth rates ([[Yache]] or [[Haban]]) between each of the rows of Chople berries. While this takes Chople berries longer to grow, it also results in longer wither times for Chople berries. While this doesn't appear to be incredibly challenging to accomplish, and uses only 4th generation berries, the berries on the ends of each row receive a diminished growth aura effect relative to more central berries on the farm. This can make timing simultaneous ripeness of all berries on the farm challenging.

## Chople + [[Petaya]]

A strategy that is easier in many respects than Chople + Yache/Haban is Chople + [[Petaya]]. Petaya is one of the final berries to unlock, and it is one of the most challenging to do so, so it might not be the most accessible option. However, the aura effect of Petaya berries "freeze" the timers of ripe berries on the farm, locking them at infinity so long as the Petaya plant is ripe. This is an incredibly powerful effect as Petaya berries remain ripe for 5 days (no modifiers). Thus, this strategy provides a very stable setup for three rows of Chople berries for much longer than using two empty rows.

#### Timing Table

Note that [[Chople]] can mutate into [[Chilan]] at taller and later stages, so you may plant [[Chople]] according to the earlier time to give more increased egg step time, but risk having to replant a few plants or you can opt for the later time and have no risk of mutation at all.

All planting times use the time-to-ripe remaining of the first planted berry for subsequent planting times.
| Berry | Planting Time with No Modifier | Planting Time with Mulch/Sprayduck | Planting Time with  Mulch+Sprayduck|
|---|---|---|---|
| [[Petaya]] | - | - | -|
| [[Babiri]] | - | - | -|
| [[Chople]] | 19 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds until ripe OR 9 hours until ripe (no [[Chilan]] chance) | 13 hours 19 mins 59 secs until ripe OR 6 hours until ripe (no [[Chilan]] chance) | 8 hours 53 mins 19 secs until ripe OR 4 hours until ripe (no [[Chilan]] chance)|
| [[Lum]] | 11 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds until ripe | 7 hours 59 mins 59 secs until ripe | 5 hours 19 mins 59 secs until ripe|
