# Special Effect
This ball has the same catch rate as a [[Poké Ball]].

When capturing a Pokémon with this ball you will get a random currency.

The currency rewarded for a catch is calculated as such:
$CurrencyReward=⌈BaseDungeonTokens * CurrencyMultiplier⌉$

The base dungeon token for each route can be found on the [[Dungeon Tokens]] page, and the Currency Multipliers are as follows:
|**Currency** | **Multiplier** {.no-data-tables}
|---|---|
|Pokédollars | 20x
|Dungeon Tokens | 1x
|Farm Points | 0.06x
|Quest Points | 0.06x
|Battle Points | 0.01x
|Diamonds | 0.001x
