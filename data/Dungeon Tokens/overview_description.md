Dungeon Tokens (DT) are blue currency earned when a Pokémon is caught. The amount is based on region and route difficulty.

#### Formulas
::: collapsed Show Dungeon Token Formulas
Dungeon Tokens gains per location are calculated via the following formula (with a minimum value of 1):

$\text{Dungeon Tokens} = 6 \times \large  \bigg(\frac{route \times (1 + \frac{region}{3}) }{1.4}\bigg)^{1.08}$ {.overflow-auto .text-center}

***Note:** For dungeon locations, each dungeon has an associated route of similar difficulty that is used in this calculation.*

In the tables further down the page, Average DT Gained per Second is calculated as follows:

$\text{Average Dungeon Token Per Second} = \large \frac{\text{Dungeon Tokens} \times \text{Average Catch \%}}{\text{Defeat Time} + \text{Catch Time}}$ {.overflow-auto .text-center}

***Note:** In the tables on this page, Defeat Time is assumed to be 1 second. Catch Time varies based on player setup.*

## Optimal Farming Routes {#optimalroutes}
Based on catch rates, each region has optimal farming routes for Dungeon Tokens. This varies based on the type of Poké Ball used (which affects catch rate and catch time), as well as the [[Oak_Items/Magic Ball]] Oak Item.

These tables assume **you can defeat these routes in 1-shot** and that your [[Oak_Items/Magic Ball]] is at max level.
