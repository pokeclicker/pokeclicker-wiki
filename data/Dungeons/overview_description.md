Dungeons include forests, caves, buildings, and other places that are accessible by spending Dungeon Tokens in which wild Pokémon are encountered. Apart from the entrance fee, they differ from routes in that only 60 seconds are given to find and defeat a "Boss Pokémon" or "Boss Trainer", after which the dungeon is considered cleared.

## General Dungeon Information
Clearing Dungeons requires active play. To enter a dungeon, select it on the Town Map and either click "Start" or press the Spacebar on the keyboard. Dungeons can be navigated either by clicking on the dungeon tiles or by using the arrow keys or **WASD** keys. Only unexplored tiles adjacent to explored tiles can be accessed. Moving to unexplored tiles in dungeons can reveal one of 4 things:

1. **Empty tiles** - You can simply move onto next tile without having to do anything.
2. **A Wild Pokémon**- Just like routes, these are Pokémon you can defeat and catch. Some Pokémon can only be found in specific dungeons.
3. **Dungeon boss** - This Pokémon must be defeated to clear the dungeon. It has more HP than normal encounters in any dungeon. You can either click "Start Bossfight" or press the Spacebar to start the fight.
4. **Ladder** - Allows the player to progress to the next floor and also adds 10 seconds to the timer. You can either click "Go to next floor" or press Spacebar. This tile can only be encountered from Alola onwards.
5. **A chest**- Many Items can be collected from chests by either clicking on them or by pressing the Spacebar. They may also contain Pokémon which are known as **Mimics**. Some of them are even exclusive Pokémon that can only be encountered in this way.
6. **A trainer**- Trainers are found on tiles and have teams of Pokémon that must all be defeated to progress. Wild Pokémon are almost always ~4 times more likely to appear on an enemy tile than a trainer, but in some dungeons this weighting is different. Defeating trainers yields the following rewards:
	- Dungeon Trainers reward 4% of the dungeon cost as Dungeon Tokens [[File:dungeonToken.svg|18px]] and 50% of the dungeon cost as Pokédollars whenever they are defeated.
	- Dungeon Trainer Bosses reward 10% of the dungeon cost as Dungeon Tokens [[File:dungeonToken.svg|18px]]  and 100% of the dungeon cost as Pokédollars whenever they are defeated.

Note: Amulet coin and other items that grant increased amounts of Pokédollars **do not** affect the amount of money that you receive from Dungeon Trainers or Dungeon Trainer Bosses

## Dungeon Perks and Mechanics

### Clear Dependent Mechanics
#### Dungeon Size

Dungeons have a minimum size floor of 5x5 and a maximum of 10x10. From Alola onwards, dungeons have two floors: the first one with maximum size (10x10) and a second floor that starts with minimum size (5x5) and that increases with each subsequent region. Galar dungeons, for example, have a first floor that is 10x10 in size and a second floor that is 6x6 in size.
Certain perks are granted to the player after clearing a Dungeon some number of times - these perks make clearing that particular Dungeon easier. When the number of clears reaches a power of ten (10, 100, 1000, etc.), the Dungeon size will shrink by 1 row and 1 column until it reaches the minimum size.

 *For example, a Hoenn dungeon cleared 100 times will now be a 5x5 sized Hoenn Dungeon instead of the base 7x7 sized Hoenn Dungeon.*

 If the dungeon has a second floor, then the second floor will get reduced first. If the second floor is already at minimum size, then the size reduction will remove this floor instead.

 *For example, clearing an Alola dungeon 10 times will remove the second floor.*

 The number of each type of tile decreases with the size of the dungeon. All dungeons will be square. Here is the breakdown of each type of tile based on size: For an NxN dungeon there are:

 **1 Boss Encounter Tile**
**N chest Tiles**
**2\*N+3 Non-Boss Encounter Tiles**
**(N+1)\*(N-4) Empty Tiles**

*Note: The entrance tile counts as an empty tile*

Dungeon Size | Chests | Non-Boss Encounter Tiles | Empty Tiles {.no-data-tables}
:--- | :---: | :---: | ---:
**5x5** | 5 | 13 | 6
**6x6** | 6 | 15 | 14
**7x7** | 7 | 17 | 24
**8x8** | 8 | 19 | 36
**9x9** | 9 | 21 | 50
**10x10** | 10 | 23 | 66

#### Flash Ability

The Flash ability permanently reveals the contents (Chest, Encounter, Empty) of adjacent unexplored tiles.
There are 3 different levels of flash that unlocks in function of the times the dungeon have been cleared:


Number of Clears | Flash layout {.no-data-tables}
:--- | ---:
**100** | 1 tile top, 1 bottom, 1 left and 1 right
**250** | 1 tile in each direction
**400** | 2 tiles top, 2 bottom, 2 left, 2 right and 1 in diagonal



### Chests in Dungeons

When a number of chests equal to a third of the dungeon's size rounded down are opened (for example, 2 chests in a 6x6 dungeon), all chest tiles are revealed. When a number of chests equal to half the dungeon's size rounded up are opened, the entire dungeon is revealed. However, each chest opened will also increase the HP of all encounters in the dungeon by 20%.

### Dungeon Loot Regional Debuff

When the furthest region reached is greater than 2 regions beyond a dungeon's region, all loot of a tier rarity greater than **Rare** (e.g: *Epic, Legendary, Mythic*) has a dramatically diminished drop rate. The below chart displays the relationship between the Highest Region Reached by the player and the Debuff Region. All Dungeons found in the Debuff Region, or in regions accessed prior to the Debuff Region, will have the debuff applied to the loot drop rate of all loot that belongs to one of the specified Tiers.  Items/mimics that cannot be obtained in a non-debuffed location are excluded so their drop rate is unchanged.

#### Regional Loot Debuff Chart

Highest Region Reached	| Debuffed Region(s) {.no-data-tables}
:--- | ---:
Kanto | N/A
Johto | N/A
Hoenn | N/A
Sinnoh | Kanto, Sevii123 (except Ruby Path)
Unova | Johto
Kalos | Hoenn, Orre1, Sevii4567 + Ruby Path
Alola | Sinnoh
Galar | Unova, Orre2

**Example:** Viridian Forest has four dungeon chest drops. Two loot items, Small Restore and Pokéball, are in Rarity Tiers of a greater rarity than Rare. **Before** the player reaches Sinnoh, the odds of finding these items increases with increasing dungeon clears, and the items will not have the Regional Debuff applied to their drop chances.
**After** the player reaches Sinnoh, only those two loot items would be impacted by the Dungeon Loot Regional Debuff in Viridian Forest. Consequently, those two loot items would become roughly 20x as rare. In general, it is better to go for rare item drops before you are affected by the debuff; however, it is more difficult to clear those early game dungeons early on.

### Tier

Dungeon chest loot is classified as belonging to a specific Tier of loot in a Dungeon. The Tier of a loot-able item indicates the Rarity of obtaining that item from a Chest.
Loot is classified into 5 tier types: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary and Mythic from least rare to most rare.
Additionally, loot items can have weights inside of their tier. Items with a higher weight in a tier have greater odds of dropping than lower weight items in a tier. Loot items have a base weight of 1.
The chances to encounter loot from **Rare tier** and rarer **increases with every clear**, while the chance to encounter **Common tier** items **decreases** up until the player reaches **500 clears**. After that, the chances will not continue increasing / decreasing. The following table only represents the base loot chance, as in, the chances of getting an item with a dungeon at 0 clears. Note that while individual dungeon pages show certain thresholds (0 / 100 / 250 / 500), it doesn't mean that the chance will **only** increase at these specific number of clears!

*Note: Dungeons that lack any items in a particular loot tier have the remaining odds from the non-present tier(s) distributed proportionally among the present tiers*

#### Tier info
The chances for each tier are the sum of the chances of all items within said tier.
Tier | 0 clears | 100 clears | 250 clears | 500 clears | Debuffed {.no-data-tables}
:--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
[[File:chest-common.png\|40px]] Common | 75% | 72% | 67.5% | 60% | 75%
[[File:chest-rare.png\|40px]] Rare | 20% | 20.99% | 22.475% | 24.95% | 24%
[[File:chest-epic.png\|40px]] Epic | 4% | 5.2% | 7% | 10% | 0.9%
[[File:chest-legendary.png\|40px]] Legendary | 0.99% | 1.59% | 2.49% | 3.99% | 0.099%
[[File:chest-mythic.png\|40px]] Mythic | 0.01% | 0.22% | 0.535% | 1.06% | 0.001%

**Example 1:** Mt. Moon has XClick and Greatball as 2 of its 5 lootable items from Dungeon chests. The XClick is in the **Common** Tier while the Greatball has the **Mythic** Tier. This means that the XClick is much more likely to drop from a chest than a Greatball.

**Example 2:** Mt. Moon has Greatball, Small Restore and Star Piece as 3 of its 5 lootable items from Dungeon chests. All 3 items are in the Mythic tier, but the Greatball Has Weight 2 while the Small Restore and Star Piece have the base weight of 1. This means the Greatball will be twice as likely to be dropped as the other 2 items. In other words, on average when an item looted from Mt. Moon is from the Mythic Tier, 50% of the time it will be a Greatball, 25% of the time it will be a Small Restore, 25% of the time it will be a Star Piece.

### Dowsing Machine

The Dowsing Machine increases the yield of items looted from Dungeons. The amount of items looted depends on both the region of the dungeon, and the Tier of the looted item. Check [[Items/Dowsing Machine]] for more details.
