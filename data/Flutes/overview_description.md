Flutes are a series of special items each with their own beneficial effect. Flutes are gained by purchasing them from the Hoenn and Unova Gem Master shops. Flutes cannot be used until the player has obtained the **Heat Badge** from the [Lavaridge Town Gym](#!Gyms/Lavaridge_Town) in [[Regions/Hoenn]].

### Usage
Flutes can be toggled on / off whenever the player wants. Each Flute buffs different properties in game, and requires 3 types of Gems to power their effects.

Activating multiple Flutes simultaneously increases the cost in gems of keeping each Flute active. Each active Flute costs one Gem per second, per active Flute, from the Flutes three gem categories. Keeping all 6 Flutes active costs 6 gems per second from every type of Gem.

Each active flute also provides a static +0.5% attack boost to the required gem types. If all 6 Flutes are active, then all types are given a +0.5% attack boost.

### Effect

The effect of each Flute is determined by achievement bonus:
`(2% x (1 + Achievement Bonus))`
