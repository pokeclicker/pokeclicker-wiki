Environment is a game mechanic that can affect Pokémon evolutions, Pokémon forms, and the catch rates of certain Poké Balls. A location's environment is usually not explicitly indicated in-game, but can be inferred by the background. A few environments, like [Moss Rock](#!Environments/Moss_Rock), are visible in Dungeons.

### Evolutions
Environmental evolutions occur when Pokémons level up in a certain environment after Level 20.

| Native Region | Pokémon | Evolves Into | Required Environment |
| --------------| ------- | --------- | ---------------------|
| Sinnoh | [[Pokémon/Magneton]] | [[Pokémon/Magnezone]] | [[Environments/Magnetic Field]] |
| Sinnoh | [[Pokémon/Nosepass]] | [[Pokémon/Probopass]] | [[Environments/Magnetic Field]] |

### Forms
Pokémon can change form when they are hatched or fed a rare candy in a certain environment.
