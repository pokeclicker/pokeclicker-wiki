Eggs are items that can be hatched to obtain Pokémon.
Eggs can be obtained in two ways: Purchasing them from [[Shops]] and trading for them from the [[Shard Traders]].
Breeding level 100 Pokémon will also add them to the [[Hatchery]]/Queue as an Egg.
Hatching an egg will boost that Pokémon's attack by 25% of its base attack.
Where an Egg is purchased or obtained from has no effect on which Pokémon will hatch from that egg *(See Egg Pool Odds section below for more details on specific odds)*.
