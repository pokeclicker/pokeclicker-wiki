##### This is a guide for how to help contribute to the wiki.

## How to edit pages
Currently, There are two ways to edit the wiki:
* By opening a Pull Request to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker-wiki). This method is needed for create **New pages** And edit **Html pages**
* Logging in the wiki through a Discord account. This method only work for edit already **existent Markdown Pages**
*We will be working on adding a better tool in the future.*

### Editing markdown pages
For editing markdown pages, you can test your changes by pressing the **edit** icon in the top right corner of each page and changing the markdown.
The changes will be shown live, and can then be added using either the GitHub website, or your GitHub tool of choice.
All of the standard markdown tools & syntax should be available. If anything is missing, ask for it on discord!
You can see some tips for markdown below, like how to make links for other wiki pages.

### Editing HTML pages
To test your changes for HTML pages, you need to run the site locally. This can be done using a tool like VS Codes "Live Server".
All game data is available for use in the HTML pages, using the framework Knockout (just like what the game is using).
To run it locally, you might need to run the command "git submodule update --remote".

### Editing Javascript
You will very rarely need to edit the Javascript files. It's only used for general stuff, which should work by now.
Try to write page specific Javascript in the Knockout, if possible.
After you have edited a Javascript file, you need to run "npm start".

### Page structure
Each page needs to have one or two HTML-pages in the "pages"-folder. The "overview.html" file should always be included. This is used to either display an overview for pages with more than one page (like Pokémon), or the full page for pages with no sub-pages (like Farm).
The "main.html" file is used for a bunch of pages, where we can auto generate the page-specific content. Like the Pokémon page, all the stats can be pulled from the game data, so no need to make a page for each individual Pokémon.

Here is a table of how a page is build, and which files should be changed to change content. We will be using Berries as example:
Page Element | File | File for example | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Page Title | Autogenerated | - | This is the title of the page. It's generated from the link.
Page description | data/"Page type"/overview_description.md OR data/"Page type"/"name"_description.md | data/Berries/overview_description.md OR data/Berries/Cheri_description.md | A short description in the start of the page. Uses Markdown.
Table of Contents | Autogenerated | - | This is the Table of Contents. It will be auto generated from the headers of the page.
Autogenerated page | pages/"Page type"/overview.html OR pages/"Page type"/"Page name".html | pages/berries/overview.html OR pages/berries/main.html | A HTML page with all the stuff that can be generated. Uses Knockout. overview.html should contain a list of the subpages (if any). main.html should fetch data from the games data, based on "Page name". If you are unsure how to generate stuff, or if stuff can be generated, please ask in the discord.
Page content | data/"Page type"/overview.md OR data/"Page type"/"name".md | data/Berries/overview.md OR data/Berries/Cheri.md | All the content that we cannot autogenerate. Uses Markdown.
