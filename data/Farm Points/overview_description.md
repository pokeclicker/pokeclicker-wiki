Farm Points are currency gained by harvesting [[Berries]] on the [[Farm]]. Different berries yield different amount of Farm Points, which are listed in each Berry's individual page as well as [below](#berryfp).

Farm Points are gained per harvest. The number of berries harvested (or increasing the number harvested) does not affect Farm Point gain.

## Tips for Earning Farm Points {#tips}

#### Farm Setups
*→ See: [[Farm/Setups]]*

* Farm Setups that speed up berry growth rate can help you earn Farm Points faster.
* [Colbur Nonsense](#!Farm/Setups#nonsense) is an active play setup for gaining Farm Points quickly.

#### Efficient Berries
Consult the Berry Farm Point Table below for most efficient berries (sort by Farm Points per second).

The most efficient berries are, in order, [[Berries/Maranga]], [[Berries/Hondew]], and [[Berries/Pinkan]].

#### Earning Farm Points with Farm Hands
*For an overview of how Farm Hands work, see [[Farm Hands]].*

You can use Farm Hands to earn Farm Points efficiently when farming either [[Berries/Lum]] or [[Berries/Hondew]] Berries.
* For farming Lum without the [[Oak_Items/Sprayduck]], the most efficient Farm Hand is [[Farm_Hands/Bailey]].
* For farming Lum with the Sprayduck, [[Farm_Hands/Kerry]] is most efficient.
* For Hondew, regardless of using the Sprayduck or not, the most efficient Farm Hand is [[Farm_Hands/Charlie]].

There are two methods:
+ Set and Forget: Set the Farm Hand to use the proper berry, fill the farm with the chosen berry, and ignore the farm until you have sufficient FP. This method is fast and easy, but loses efficiency as the Farm Hands will leave empty plots on the farm between harvesting and planting berries (Farm Hands first attempt to harvest as many berries as they can, and then plant new berries if there are no berries left to harvest).
+ Maximum Efficiency: Set the Farm Hand to use the proper berry, plant the (Farm Hand's Efficiency stat / 2) number of berries as a group at a time, each grouping being at least the Farm Hand's Work Speed stat apart. This setup takes a bit of time, but earns you more FP per hour, and once the setup is done you can ignore the farm until you have sufficient FP. This will lead to the Farm Hand harvesting and replanting the berry grouping as soon as they can, earning more FP with less wasted time. For example, using Bailey while farming Lum, plant groups of up to 6 berries at a time, each 5 minutes or more apart for maximum efficiency.
