Ripe [Berry](#!Berries) plants on the [[Farm]] have a chance to attract Wandering Pokémon (or Wanderers).

## Attracting Wanderers {#attracting}
Only Berry plants at the ripe stage attract Wanderers. Each ripe Berry has a base chance of **1/2000 every 1.5 seconds** to attract a Wandering Pokémon.

* [[Berries/Roseli]] auras increase the chance of Wanderers appearing for *all* Berries on the Farm. (See [Wandering Pokémon Farm Setups](#!Farm/Setups#wanderers))


Some Pokémon are attracted to all Berries, while others are picky and will only appear on specific Berry types or specific Berry colors. Any Pokémon that *can* appear has an equal base chance to appear.
* Applying [[Items/Gooey Mulch]] **doubles** the chance that a Berry-specific or color-specific Wanderer will appear (Note: It does not increase the chance of attracting wanderers, only the kind of Pokémon that appears). Gooey Mulch also increases the catch rate.

The base chance for the Wandering Pokémon to be **shiny** is 1/1024. Catching a shiny Wanderer when there is at least one open plot on the Farm plants a [[Berries/Starf]] Berry in that open plot. This chance is affected by anything that affect [[Shiny Chance]].

## Catching Wanderers {#catching}
To interact with a Wanderer, click on them. If your catch filters are setup to catch this Pokémon, you will attempt to catch the Pokémon (A spinning Poké Ball indicator will appear when using the main Farm window, but there is no such indicator in the small Farm module). Interacting with a Wanderer earns you [[Farm Points]], whether you catch it or not. Successfully capturing one will also earn you Dungeon Tokens.

If the Berry is harvested or withers, the Wanderer will flee after a five minutes. Otherwise, they will stay as long as their host Berry lives.

The amount of Farm Points awarded depends on the Farm Point harvest value and the growth time of the berry the Pokémon is attracted to. The amount of Dungeon Tokens awarded affected by the highest region the player stepped in and the native region of the Wandering Pokémon.

::: collapsed Wanderer Reward Formulas

Amount of [[Farm Points]]:

$$ \text{Wanderer Farm Points} =  \frac{\text{Berry Farm Points}}{ 4 + \frac{\text{Berry Growth Time}} { 1800}} $$

Amount of [[Dungeon Tokens]] (DT) is based on the DT awarded on a random route in the highest region the player has unlocked, and is affected by any other multipliers that apply to DT:

$$ \text{route} = \text{random route from}   ⌊\Bigg( (\text{totalroutes}-1) \times \frac{\text{pokemon region}}{\text{highest region}+2} \Bigg)⌋  \text{to}   ⌊\Bigg( (\text{totalroutes}-1) \times \frac{\text{pokemon region}+2}{\text{highest region}+2} \Bigg)⌋ $$
