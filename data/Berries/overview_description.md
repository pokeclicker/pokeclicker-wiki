Berries can be grown in the Farm to earn Farm Points. You can trade certain berries for Masterballs, Protein, and other Evolution Items at Berry Master shops.

### Features
#### Related Oak Items

The Sprayduck, Squirtbottle, and Sprinklotad are all Oak Items that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.

#### Wanderers
Farms with at least one ripe Berry can attract Wandering Pokémon that are automatically caught without the use of a Pokéball. Some Berries can attract rare Pokémon and can thus be used strategically to complete the Pokédex. Wandering Pokémon can also be shiny, attracting a shiny Wandering Pokémon when the Farm has at least one empty plot is the condition for a Starf Berry to spawn on the Farm (in one of the empty plots).

### Mutations

The first 10 berries are get in routes or dungeons, but after that player need to generate new berries through **mutation**. Each berry require a specific conditions to be able to mutate. Kanto berry master will give a different hint daily for berry mutations.

Most berries can start mutating once they are in the Berry stage (fully Ripe) until they die. Evolution *(a berry transforming into another)* and flavour mutations can happen in any moment since taller stage. For mutations involving flavor requirements all berries emit flavour points since taller stage  (berries have 0.5x flavor in the "taller" stage, 0.75x flavor in the "bloom" stage, and 1x flavor in the "berry" stage)

If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously, the mutation triggered will be random as well.
