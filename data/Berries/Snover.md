## Mutation Strategy {#mutation}

### Possible Planting Formations {#planting}

Pokémon #459 [[Pokémon/Snover]] must be caught to unlock this berry. You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Snover Berries. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.

**Note:** Snover Berries require 20 [[Berries/Babiri]] berries for mutation to be possible. This berry, however, has an aura that nullifies mutations which means that, while other formations than the one given here may be more effective, [[Items/Freeze Mulch]] may be necessary to make mutation possible in those cases.
