## Catch Filters
Catch filters are a set of conditions that dictate what Pokéballs will be thrown (or not thrown) on different Pokémon. New filters can be created to aid with more personal needs e.g. for [[Catch Type Quests]] or gaining [EVs](#!Pokérus#Effort_Values) on certain Pokémon.

Catch filter priority is set from top to bottom by default, so higher filters have a higher priority.

**Note**: Setting a catch filter to 'Do not catch' is ***not*** the same as disabling it, and doing so may lead to interference with other catch filters. To properly disable a filter, right-click on it or go into the filter settings and toggle the enable button.
