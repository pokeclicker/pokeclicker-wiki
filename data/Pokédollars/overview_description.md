## Formulas
#### Earnings
$$ \text{Earnings} = \max(10,3 \times \text{route}(\text{order}) + 5 \times \text{route}^{1.15} + \text{Deviation}) $$
$$ \text{Deviation} = Floor([\text{Random Integer between 0 and 1}] \times 51) - 25 \text{ or } \text{Deviation} = 12 $$
#### Offline Earnings
$$ \text{Offline Earnings} = \text{Number Of Pokemon Defeated} \times \text{routeMoney} \times 0.5 $$

**Number of Pokemon Defeated** is equivalent to the number of Pokemon that would be defeated on a particular route by only Pokémon damage.
**Route Money** is a route specific constant.

## Optimal Farming Locations

It is always most efficient to farm money on the highest strength route when idling. When actively playing, it is not always most efficient to gain Poké by defeating the highest strength gym that can be one-shot, as some early gyms in later regions do not yield as high amounts of Poké per pokémon.

**In general, the most efficient location to idle is the highest HP route/gym that can be one-shot.** For this table, if two Gyms are tied for efficiency the easier Gym will be bolded.

Region | Route | Gym
:---:| :---: |:---:
Kanto | 23 | Cinnabar Island & Champion Blue
Johto | 28 | Johto Elite Four (All equivalent, Will is the easiest)
Hoenn | 134 | Champion Wallace
Sinnoh | 230 | Champion Cynthia
Unova | 18 | Champion Iris
Kalos | 21 | Champion Diantha
Alola | Poni Gauntlet | Alola Gyms (All equivalent, Hala is the easiest)
Galar | Path to the Peak | Elite Peony
