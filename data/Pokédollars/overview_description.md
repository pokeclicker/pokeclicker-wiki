Pokédollars are the basic golden currency of PokéClicker, also known as simply Money or Poké.

They are obtained by defeating enemies in [[Routes]], [[Dungeons]], and [[Gyms]]. Pokédollars can be collected while offline for up to 24 hours.

::: collapsed Pokédollar Earnings Formulas

Route earnings are calculated as follows (with a minimum earnings of 10):
$$ \text{Earnings} = 3 \times \text{route}(\text{order}) + 5 \times \text{route}^{1.15} + \text{Deviation} $$
$$ \text{Deviation} = Floor([\text{Random Integer between 0 and 1}] \times 51) - 25 \text{ or } \text{Deviation} = 12 $$
#### Offline Earnings
$$ \text{Offline Earnings} = \text{Number Of Pokemon Defeated} \times \text{routeMoney} \times 0.5 $$

**Number of Pokemon Defeated** is equivalent to the number of Pokemon that would be defeated on a particular route by only Pokémon damage.
**Route Money** is a route specific constant.
