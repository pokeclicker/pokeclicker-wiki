## Acquisition

The Chople berry can be acquired by equipping the [[Oak Items/Magma Stone]] while there is a [[Berries/Spelon]] at Taller stage or later on the field. The Spelon will then have a chance to mutate into Chople.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, the Chople berry can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 Farm Points.
