.The **Battle Frontier** is a location in Hoenn where your Pokémon fight endless teams of three randomly generated Pokémon. There is a 30 second time limit for each stage - if you do not defeat the three Pokémon within the time limit you will be awarded Pokédollars and Battle Points. *(you won't be awarded if you quit)*
Items such as XAttack are permitted; however, you **cannot** Click to damage Pokémon in the Battle Frontier and the time flute **does not** have any effect.

## Details

Attack is calculated as 100% of the total attack of all obtained Pokémon - the Regional Attack debuff is ignored. Attack can be further increased through modifiers such as Gems and XAttack. Battle Points and Pokédollars are awarded upon defeat; the former can be used at the Battle Frontier Shop. The higher the stage cleared, the more Battle Points are awarded.
Frontier stages that have already been cleared in previous attempts will be cleared twice as fast in subsequent attempts

### Breeding Strategy

As described above, Pokémon Attack speed is doubled on cleared stages in the Battle Frontier. Additionally, the amount of egg steps gained by a single Pokémon in the Battle Frontier is as follows:

Egg Steps = `Stage Number ^ 0.5`

The combination of these two features in particular can lead to extremely efficient breeding in the Battle Frontier that rivals (and often surpasses) many other high efficiency breeding locations currently in the game.

### Gems

Defeating Pokémon in the Battle Frontier also awards [[Gems]] depending on the types of said Pokémon. The number of gems gained follow this formula:

Gems = `Stage Number / 80`

*The result is rounded up as partial gems cannot be obtained.*

## Rewards
### Currencies

**Note:** Currency Rewards are not awarded if your Battle Frontier run is Quit. You must lose your attempt normally to gain Pokédollars and Battle Points.

Currency Reward | Formula
:--- | ---:
Pokédollars | `Stage Beaten ^ 2`
Battle Points\* | `(Stage Beaten ^ 2) / 100`

\* *Battle Points are rounded to the nearest whole number*
