Regions are areas in the world of Pokémon. Each new region introduces a new set of [[Routes]], [[Towns]], [[Gyms]] and [[Pokémon]]. Pokémon that are not native to a region get a damage debuff, but with each new region entered, this debuff decreases by 10%. Furthermore, some region offer unique gameplay elements.

#### [[Regions/Kanto]]
Kanto is the first region and introduces the player to the core gameplay features. There are 151 unique Pokémon to catch and breed. Step by step the player gets introduced to the mechanics of breeding and hatching Pokémon, digging up items in the Underground, growing [[Berries]] on the [[Farm]], finishing Quests, the usage of [[Oak_Items]], [[Gems]], and Achievements.

By giving [[Items/Protein]] to obtained Pokémon the amount of added damage per breeding cycle is increased, but the number of egg steps also increases. Protein becomes available towards the end of Kanto at the [[Towns/Indigo_Plateau_Kanto]].

A unique feature in Kanto is the [[Towns/Safari_Zone]], where the player can freely move and catch Pokémon with the support of throwing rocks increase the capture chance and feeding bait to decrease the fleeing chance of encountered Pokémon.

Maximum Vitamins per Pokémon: 5**

#### [[Regions/Johto]]
Johto is the second region where the player can catch another 100 unique Pokémon. The newly introduced feature in this region is the breeding queue.
This is the first region where the damage debuff becomes noticeable. Any non-native Pokémon receives a damage debuff based on the number of discovered regions. Each discovered and visited region including Kanto decreases the debuff by 10%. E.g. if the overall damage of the Pokémon was 10,000 in Kanto, it will decrease to 2,000 in Johto. Pokémon that are native to Johto deal 100% of their damage in Johto. Upon moving to Kanto via the Dock, it is vice versa. Johto-native Pokémon deal only 20% of their damage in Kanto, while the Kanto-native Pokémon deal 100% in their native region.

The breeding queue allows the player to queue up 4 Pokémon besides the 4 currently breeding eggs. As soon as the Pokémon are queued up, their damage is no longer added to the overall damage of the team until they are either bred and hatched or otherwise removed from the queue.
In Johto the player has the opportunity to get another Oak item to boost the farm.

#### [[Regions/Hoenn]]
Hoenn is the third region and the player can catch another 135 unique Pokémon here. The player will find the last missing Oak item here and can take the challenge of the Battle Frontier. There is also a Pokémon that appears based on the current weather here. [[Items/Calcium]] becomes available for purchase, which increases damage when bred by a percentage of attack, rather than by a flat increase. Finally, completing Hoenn offers access to [[Regions/Orre]] as well as [[Regions/Sevii 4567]].

In the Battle Frontier the player can take a challenge and win great prizes, including 4 unique Pokémon. It is not necessary for the progression to Sinnoh to capture these Pokémon from the [[Battle_Frontier]]. To reach the last prize at stage 386 the player should have a minimum of 1,000,000 attack damage including all gems at maximum. Manual clicks are not possible in the Battle Frontier.
