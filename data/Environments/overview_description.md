Some game mechanics are dependant on the area a player is located in. These special locations are called Environments.

### Pokémon

Environmental evolutions occur when leveled up to or after level 20. Pokémon affected by this are listed below by [native region](#!Regions).

#### Sinnoh:

- [[Pokémon/Magneton]] into [[Pokémon/Magnezone]] in a [[Environments/Magnetic Field]]
- [[Pokémon/Nosepass]] into [[Pokémon/Probopass]] in a [[Environments/Magnetic Field]]
- [[Pokémon/Eevee]] into [[Pokémon/Leafeon]] in a [Moss Rock Environment](#!Environments/Moss_Rock)
- [[Pokémon/Eevee]] into [[Pokémon/Glaceon]] in an [Ice Rock Environment](#!Environments/Ice_Rock)

Burmy also changes its form depending on the environment, switching between [(Plant)](#!Pokémon/Burmy_(Plant)), [(Sand)](#!Pokémon/Burmy_(Sand)), and [(Trash)](#!Pokémon/Burmy_(Trash)) forms.

#### Alola:
- [[Pokémon/Charjabug]] into [[Pokémon/Vikavolt]] in a [[Environments/Magnetic Field]]
