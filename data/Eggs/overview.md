## Egg Pool Odds {#EggPoolOdds}

As you enter subsequent [[Regions]], the odds of obtaining Pokémon from Eggs from prior Regions decreases to 50% of its prior rate.
The Kanto and Johto pools are given equal odds in every region (excluding Kanto).
The [[Items/Mystery Egg]] will pull randomly from its own pool and all typed egg pools, making it most useful when you have not obtained any egg Pokémon for that region yet.

## Tips and Tricks

The roll for what Pokémon a particular Typed Egg/Mystery Egg will be is performed when the Egg is put into a Hatchery Slot.
Eggs that are put into the queue will have a generic Egg Image - the roll is specifically only made when the Egg is put into a Hatchery Slot.
Thus, players can "Save Scum" (ie: re-load their save).
By comparing the Egg Image of the Egg in the hatchery to Egg Image of their desired Pokémon, players can obtain a desired Pokémon and use a minimal amount of Eggs.
