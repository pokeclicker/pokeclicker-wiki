Flutes are items that can be activated for global boosts. Each Flute is associated with 3 different types and requires [[Gems]] of those type to use.

Flutes can be purchased in [[Towns/Fallarbor Town]] and [[Towns/Undella Town]], after you have obtained the Heat Badge from [Lavaridge Town Gym](#!Gyms/Lavaridge_Town) in [[Regions/Hoenn]].

## Usage
Flutes can be toggled on and off freely. Active Flutes consume 1 Gem (of each type it costs) per second, per active Flute. Activating multiple Flutes at once increases the cost for *all* currently active Flutes.

For example, having both the [[Items/Red Flute]] and [[Items/Blue Flute]] active will use 2 Fire, 2 Rock, 2 Dragon, 2 Water, 2 Bug, and 2 Ghost Gems every second. Having all 6 Flutes active uses 6 Gems of every type per second.

#### Effect Bonus
The bonus of each Flute is determined by your [achievement bonus](#!Achievements):

$Flute Bonus = \large 0.02 * (1 + \frac{\text{Achievement Bonus \%}}{100} )${.overflow-auto .text-center}

Currently, with the maximum achievement bonus of 1100%, Flutes can provide a maximum of 1.2x multiplier for their associated effects.

#### Attack Bonus
Each active flute also provides a static **+0.5% attack boost** to the 3 types associated with the Flute. If all 6 Flutes are active, then all types gain a +0.5% attack boost.
