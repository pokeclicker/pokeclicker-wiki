# pokeclicker-wiki
A static wiki for the idle clicker game PokéClicker.

This is currently a proof of concept.

It has access to the PokéClicker code, and can use that to auto generate pages.

## Editing pages:
To edit the markdown for a page, create a `.md` file in the `data` directory.

The folder and file name should follow the page name: `https://wiki.pokeclicker.com/#!Items/Charti_Berry` would link to `data/Items/Charti Berry.md`.

## Updating game files to latest version:
Run `npm run update` to download the latest game files.
