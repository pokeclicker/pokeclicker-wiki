Some [[Pokémon]] have Alternate Forms. Only one Form is required to complete the Pokédex; however, obtaining all the forms of a Pokémon is highly recommended.

**Note:** Unown forms are available in three dungeons: [[Dungeons/Ruins of Alph]], [[Dungeons/Solaceon Ruins]], and [[Dungeons/Tanoby Ruins]]. Each one of them has exclusive Unown that can only be found in said location which are, in order, [[Pokémon/Unown (F)]], [[Pokémon/Unown (H)]], [[Pokémon/Unown (P)]] in Alph; [[Pokémon/Unown (E)]] in Solaceon; and [[Pokémon/Unown (!)]] and [[Pokémon/Unown (?)]] in Tanoby.

**WARNING**: This list includes some Pokémon that are not yet obtainable.
