Click Attack is the damage the player inflicts upon the opposing Pokémon when clicking during a battle.

[[Achievements]] and Pokémon contribute to the player's click attack value. The formula used is the following:
$ClickAttack=⌊(1 + achievementBonus) * (numCaught + numShiny + numResistant + numPurified + 1) ^ {1.4}⌋$

Where **numCaught**, **numShiny**,  **numResistant**, and **numPurified** refers to the number of unique captured Pokémon, unique shiny Pokémon, unique Pokémon resisted, and unique Pokémon purified respectively.
