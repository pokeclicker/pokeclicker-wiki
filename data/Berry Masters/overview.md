## Items for Sale {#itemsforsale}
Item prices increase with repeat purchases and decrease by harvesting Berries on the Farm. Price inflation/deflation is shared across all Berry Master shops. *(This only affects items bought with Farm Points. Berry trades do not have inflation/deflation.)*

## Berry Trades {#trades}
Berry Masters have different inventory and berry requests every day. Items will always cost a certain amount of berries from specific generations, but the quantity and berry type changes daily.

Trades prices do not increase, regardless of quantity exchanged. All players have the same trades and trade prices every day.
- See [[Daily Deals]] for currently available trades.
- Visit [PokéClicker Companion](https://companion.pokeclicker.com/#!Forecast/Berry/GoldenrodCity) for forecasts and next available trade date for any specific item.

Berries generations are based on ID number. All berries have the same chance of being selected among its generation.

- Generation 1 is [Cheri #1](/#!Berries/Cheri) → [Sitrus #8](/#!Berries/Sitrus)
- Generation 2 is [Persim #9](/#!Berries/Persim) → [Lum #20](/#!Berries/Lum)
- Generation 3 is [Pomeg #21](/#!Berries/Pomeg) → [Pinkan #36](/#!Berries/Pinkan)
- Generation 4 is [Occa #37](/#!Berries/Occa) → [Roseli #54](/#!Berries/Roseli)
- Generation 5 is [Snover #55](/#!Berries/Snover) and up, but Berry Masters will only ever request Berries with a total growth time of under 24 hours. ([[Berries/Micle]], [[Berries/Custap]], [[Berries/Jaboca]], [[Berries/Rowap]], [[Berries/Kee]] & [[Berries/Maranga]])
