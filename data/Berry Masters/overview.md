Berry Masters offer [[Farm]] specific information, special items, and rotating [[Daily Deals]] in exchange for specific berries.  There are five Berry Masters in the game, located in [[Towns/Cerulean City]], [[Towns/Goldenrod City]], [[Towns/Mauville City]], [[Towns/Hearthome City]] and [[Towns/Driftveil City]].   The Berry Master in Cerulean is an NPC and only offers daily hints for undiscovered berries, while the other four are shops who trade and sell items.

## Shops
Item prices increase with repeat purchases and decrease by harvesting Berries on the Farm.  Price inflation/deflation is shared across all Berry Master shops, but does not apply to trades.  FP stands for [[Farm Points]].

## Trades
See [[Daily Deals]] for currently available trades.  Visit [PokéClicker Companion](https://companion.pokeclicker.com/#!Forecast/Berry/GoldenrodCity) for forecasts and next available trade date for any specific item.  Trades always have stable prices for that day, regardless of quantity exchanged.  For trade balancing purposes, berries are divided up into generations based on ID number.  Equal odds are assigned to any given berry being selected randomly, and all players will have the same trades every day.

- Generation 1 is Cheri #1 through Sitrus #8
- Generation 2 is Persim #9 through Lum #20
- Generation 3 is Pomeg #21 through Pinkan #36
- Generation 4 is Occa #37 through Roseli #54
- Generation 5 is Snover #55 and up, but limited to berries with a total growth time of under 24 hours. (Micle, Custap, Jaboca, Rowap, Kee & Maranga)
