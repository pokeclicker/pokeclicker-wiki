Berries are dropped from wild Pokémon, Dungeon Chests, and can be grown and mutated in the [[Farm]]. Berries can be used to [trade](#trades) for items and Pokémon. Berry plants also be used for their [auras](#aura) or to attract [[Wandering Pokémon]].

Berry plants grow in four stages (Sprout → Taller → Bloom → Ripe). If left unharvested, they will wither after a certain amount of time. For the basics of growing berries, see the [Farm](#!Farm#growing) page.

For detailed information on growing each Berry, ways to acquire them, and Wanderers they attract, see the Berry's [individual page](#list).

## Berry Stats and Properties {#stats}
The stats for Berry plants can be modified by various items and auras. Such effects are usually multiplicative.

| Stat/Property {.col-1}| Description {.col-3}| Things That Can Affect It {.col-3}|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Color** | The Berry's color. Some Wanderers are only attracted to certain color Berries. | |
| **Flavors** | The Berry's flavors. A common mutation requirement. | Berries begin to have flavors at the Taller stage of growth. They have 50% of their flavor points at the Taller stage, 75% at Bloom, and full flavor points at Ripe. |
| **Growth Time** | How long it takes for a Berry plant to reach the Ripe stage. | _**Speeds up Growth Time:** Sprayduck, Boost or Amaze [Mulch](#!Farm#farmtools), [[Berries/Wacan]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Stops Growth Time:** Freeze Mulch_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
| **Wither Time** | How long it takes for a ripe Berry plant to wither. | _**Slows down Wither Time:** [[Berries/Yache]] and [[Berries/Haban]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Speeds up Wither Time:** Sprayduck, Boost or Amaze Mulch, [[Berries/Kasib]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Pauses Wither Time:** Freeze Mulch, [[Berries/Petaya]] Aura_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
| **Exp** | Amount of Farm EXP gained per harvest. Used to level [[Oak Items/Sprayduck]]. | |
| **Harvest Amount** | Amount of Berries gained per harvest. Berry plants will always yield at least 1 berry, even if the Harvest Amount is less than 1, but multiplying boosts will use the actual value.* | _**Increases Harvest:** Rich or Amaze Mulch, [[Berries/Passho]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Decreases Harvest:** [[Berries/Tanga]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
| **Replant Chance** | Chance of replanting itself if the Berry withers |  _**Increases Replant Chance:** Rich or Amaze Mulch, [[Berries/Shuca]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal}  _**Decreases Replant Chance:** [[Berries/Charti]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
| **Mutation Chance** | Chance for a plot to mutate into this Berry, when mutation conditions are met | _**Increases Mutation Chance:** [[Oak Items/Sprinklotad]], Surprise or Amaze Mulch, [[Berries/Kebia]] and [[Berries/Payapa]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Decreases Mutation Chance:** [[Berries/Babiri]] Auras_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
| **Farm Points per Harvest** | Farm points awarded per harvest. Also affects how much FP is earned per Wanderer. | |
| **Aura** | [Aura](#aura) emitted that can have various gameplay effects | _**Stops Aura**: Freeze Mulch_{.d-block .fst-normal} _**Boosts Aura effects**: [[Berries/Lum]] Aura (does not stack)_{.d-block .fst-normal} |
**e.g. Liechi with a Harvest Amount of .5 will yield 1 berry when harvested. When Rich Mulch is applied (x2 harvest multiplier), it will still only yield 1 berry. When Rich Mulch and 8 Passho auras are present (x16.32 harvest multiplier), it will yield 8 berries.*

## Mutations{#mutation}

Except for the first 8 Berries, [[Berries/Kasib]], and [[Berries/Starf]], all other Berries can be acquired via mutation.

Each Berry has special conditions for mutating and a different chance of mutating. Mutation has a chance of happening **once per second** for every Farm plot where conditions are met. A plot may meet the mutation conditions for multiple Berries, in which case, any of those mutations can occur. For mutations that involve adjacency, plots are considered adjacent if they are touching from any direction (i.e. orthogonally or diagonally).

When a mutation is possible on a farm plot, it is marked by a green dot.


::: collapsed Basic Mutation Example

::: table-mutations
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| |{.mutation}|{.mutation}| | |
| |[[File:Pecha.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Pecha]] |[[File:Oran.png\|32px]] [[Berries/Oran]] | | |
| |{.mutation}|{.mutation}| | |

Persim has a mutation rate of 2% when ripe Oran and Pecha plants are adjacent to an empty plot. The purple highlighted plots show where mutation is possible. Each second, each highlighted plot independently has a 2% chance of spawning a Persim. Over one minute, there are a total of 240 checks for mutation in this setup (4 possible plots, 60 checks per plot), with a 2% chance of successfully mutating in each check. Thus, there is a 99% chance at least one Persim will mutate in one of the 4 plots after one minute.

#### Types of Mutation {#mutationtypes}
- **Growth Mutations** are mutations that occur **on empty plots that are adjacent to the required Berry plants**. These mutations do not occur before the required Berries are ripe, and these mutations cannot spawn on an occupied plot. Growth mutations are the most common type of mutation.
- **Evolution Mutations** are mutations that **replace an existing Berry plant with a mutated Berry**. Evolution mutations can mutate any Berry plants at the Taller, Bloom, or Ripe stage.
- **Field Mutations** are mutations that occur **on empty plots when the required Berry plants exist across the entire Farm**. Field mutations can occur on any empty plot in the Farm.

#### Tips for Mutation {#mutationtips}
##### Berry Guides
- Individual Berry pages have optimized planting formations to maximize the chances of mutating each Berry, as well as timing charts to help plant at the correct times.
- The Kanto Berry Master in [[Towns/Cerulean City]] gives daily hints for Berries you haven't yet acquired.
- [Walkthrough for unlocking #9 Persim to #25 Grepa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TE5cAKSlA7TAliA001_mIiO1odZ6e4yUEMre0GBW1to/edit?usp=sharing)  (external link): If you have not yet unlocked all the plots on the Farm, this guide will provide optimized planting formations to mutate those berries within the limited available farm plots.

##### Preventing Unwanted Mutations
- A **fully grown [[Berries/Babiri]]** will prevent mutations in adjacent plots. This is the only way to prevent mutations, if a mutation could otherwise occur.
- Freeze Mulch does **not** prevent mutations.
- Be aware of Berry types that can easily mutate or cause mutations:
    - [[Berries/Occa]], [[Berries/Kebia]], [[Berries/Colbur]], and [[Berries/Enigma]] can mutate adjacent berries when ripe.
    - [[Berries/Rindo]] and [[Berries/Pamtre]] can mutate adjacent empty plots when ripe.
    - [[Berries/Spelon]], [[Berries/Pamtre]], [[Berries/Watmel]], and [[Berries/Cornn]] can mutate into different berries when certain Oak Items are equipped.
    - [[Berries/Passho]] can mutate when it is not adjacent to any berry.
