Farm Hands are helpers that can be hired to work on your [[Farm]]. Farm hands can automatically perform these actions:
- Planting a Berry
- Harvesting a Berry
- Catching a [[Wandering Pok√©mon]]

Farm Hands earn you the same amount of Farm Points as doing the actions manually.

#### Hiring Farm Hands
Farm Hands can be acquired by unlocking a certain number of Berries or purchasing them from shops. To hire, go to the Farm Hands tab of the Farm modal. Farm Hands cost [[Farm Points]] to hire hourly. Once hired, Farm Hands will work until they are fired. Up to 3 Farm Hands can be hired at a time.

You can customize the type of actions they do and where:
- **Berry Planting** allows you to pick a specific Berry for the Farm Hand to plant
- **Should Harvest** allows Farm Hands to harvest berries from plots
- **Allowed Plots** opens a dropdown that allows you to limit which plots the Farm Hand can work on. Green plots are allowed.

[Locking a plot](#!Farm#lockplots) will also prevent a Farm Hand from planting or harvesting in that plot (they will still catch Wanderers).


#### Work Cycles

Farm Hands can work when their **Work Cycle** timer finishes counting down. They perform all of their actions at the same time, with a maximum amount of actions set by their **Efficiency** stat.

Farm Hands spend **1 Energy** when they work, regardless of the number of actions done (if they perform at least 1 one action). If they are out of energy or if there are no actions to be done, they will rest and recover 1 Energy instead.

#### Stats

| Stat {.col-1}| Description  {.col-2}| Usage  {.col-5}|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
**Cost** | Hourly wage of the Farm Hand | Cost is deducted from your Farm Points every hour that the Farm Hand is employed.
**Work Speed** | How often the Farm Hand works | The length of their Work Cycle.
**Efficiency** | How many actions the Farm Hand can perform each work cycle | Each individual action is counted separately (e.g harvesting 3 berries and replanting the 3 plots requires 6 actions. A Farm Hand with 5 efficiency can harvest 3 berries and replant only 2 of the plots during that cycle). Farm Hands will always prioritize harvesting berries over replanting them.
**Max Energy** | The maximum energy a Farm Hand can have at one time | How much energy a Farm Hand starts with. The current energy of a Farm Hand can be seen by hovering over the hired Farm Hand.
