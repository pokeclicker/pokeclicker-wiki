## Mutation Strategy {#mutation}

### Possible Planting Formations {#planting}

Pinkan has a chance of mutating by surrounding an empty plot with all Pink colored berries from #3 [[Berries/Pecha]] to #33 [[Berries/Watmel]]. Also, you MUST have started the Questline [[Quest Lines/Team Rocket's Pinkan Theme Park]] in order to be able to mutate this berry. You can fill your farm in the following way to obtain Pinkan Berries. Purple squares indicate where mutations can occur.
**Note:** The planted berries can cause [[Berries/Roseli]] or [[Berries/Magost]] to mutate in the purple squares adjacent to them. If you don't want those berries be ready to shovel them up in order to reopen the spot for Pinkan to mutate.
**WARNING:** Trying to mutate Pinkan while having the [[Oak Items/Sprinklotad]] equipped may result in your Watmel mutating into Shuca.
