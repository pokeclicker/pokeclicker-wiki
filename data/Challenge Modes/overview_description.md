**Challenge Modes** are in-game options that change the difficulty of the game. They can only be activated at the start of a playthrough, but can be turned off anytime. **Once a challenge is deactivated it cannot be activated on that save file again.**

Challenges activated in a player's save will be shown in that save's trainer profile card using the icons below. There are no rewards for completing the challenges, but it is recommended to play with **Regional Attack Debuff** and **Require Complete Pokédex** Challenges turned on, as the game is balanced around them. Any other Challenge is purely for bragging rights. The game is always designed to be 100% completable, even with all challenges active (although the methods may be different). The recommended challenges are selected by default, however, you can click on them to disable that challenge.  [[Achievements]] made impossible by a Challenge Mode are removed; i.e. the [[Oak Items]] quests will not be required on a file that has "No Oak Items" challenge, and the percentages redistributed to other achievements that are possible to complete.
