*Note: The minimum harvest amount for any berry is 1. If the harvest amount is less than 1, you will still get at least 1. However, having a harvest amount of less than 1 affects how many berries you get from Rich Mulch and Passho berries. For example, with Rich Mulch and surrounded by 8 Passho berries, a Maranga will yield 16 berries, but a Liechi will only yield 8 berries.*

## Special Abilities (Auras)

Some berries have special abilities, also called Auras. These auras often affect other berry growth and mutation, but others may affect other sections of the game. These auras are frequently used to help players find shiny pokémon or breed more efficiently. Here is a list of berry auras.

Aura | Effect | Notes | Berries
:--- | :---: | :---: | :---
**Aura boost** | Boosts aura effects of the 8 surrounding berries | This aura can only be applied to a berry once and does not affect other berries with this effect. | @[[Berries/Lum]]
**Overgrow** | Plants a berry of the same type in one of the 8 surrounding empty plots | Original berry needs to be ripe before this takes effect. This counts as a mutation and is affected by the same mutation Boosts and isn't stopped by Freeze mulch | @[[Berries/Rindo]] @[[Berries/Pamtre]]
**Parasite** | Transforms a berry in one of the 8 surrounding berries into the same berry as the parasite | Original berry needs to be ripe before this takes effect. This counts as a mutation and is affected by the same mutation Boosts. Parasite only affects berries in the taller and later stages. Seed and sprout cannot be taken over. The newly taken over berry will start its timer at the start of the same stage as it was taken over. This counts as a mutation and is affected by the same mutation Boosts and isn't stopped by Freeze mulch. The chance of this mutation is **0.04%**. | @[[Berries/Occa]] @[[Berries/Kebia]] @[[Berries/Colbur]]
**Death** | Causes the surrounding 8 berries to wither more quickly  | Only affects ripe berries. Does not affect other berries with Death aura. Effect does not stack. | @[[Berries/Kasib]]
**Harvest Amount** | Changes the number of berries obtained on harvest/wither for the 8 surrounding berries. | Effect is multiplicative and stacks with Rich Mulch | @[[Berries/Passho]] @[[Berries/Tanga]]
**Growth Rate** | Changes growth time of the 8 surrounding berries | Effect is multiplicative and stacks with Sprayduck and Boost Mulch effects. | @[[Berries/Wacan]]
**Decay Rate** | Changes wither time of the 8 surrounding berries | Effect is multiplicative and stacks with Death aura, Sprayduck, and Boost Mulch effects. | @[[Berries/Yache]] @[[Berries/Haban]]
**Replant Chance** | Changes the chance that any of the 8 surrounding berries will replant itself after withering | Effect is multiplicative and stacks with Sprinklotad |  @[[Berries/Charti]] @[[Berries/Shuca]]

**Kasib Prevention** | Prevents berries from mutating into Kasib berries when they wither | A single berry with this ability will affect the entire field | @[[Berries/Colbur]]
**Wither Prevention** | Prevents other berries from withering while this berry is ripe | A single berry with this ability will affect the entire field. Berries with this ability do not affect each other. Once this berry withers or is harvested other berries will reset their timers from the beginning of the Ripe stage. | @[[Berries/Petaya]]
