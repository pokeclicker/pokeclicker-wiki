## Obtaining Farm Points

The three most efficient Berries to gather Farm Points quickly are, in order:

1. [[Berries/Maranga]] [[File:Maranga.png\|25px]]
2. [[Berries/Hondew]] [[File:Hondew.png\|25px]]
3. [[Berries/Pinkan]] [[File:Pinkan.png\|25px]]

#### Earning Farm Points with Farm Hands
While there is no efficient way to earn Farm Points (FP) with Farm Hands when using the [[Berries/Cheri]] berrry, you can use farmhands to earn FP efficiently when farming either [[Berries/Lum]] or [[Berries/Hondew]] Berries. For farming Lum without the [[Oak_Items/Sprayduck]], the most efficient Farm Hand to use is [[Farm_Hands/Bailey]]. With the sprayduck, [[Farm_Hands/Kerry]] is most efficient. For Hondew, regardless of using the sprayduck or not, [[Farm_Hands/Charlie]] is the most efficient Farm Hand. The method of farming with farmhands is pretty simple, though there are two different methods to do so.
+ Set and Forget - set the Farm Hand to use the proper berry, fill the farm with the chosen berry, ignore the farm until you have sufficient FP. This method is fast and easy, but loses efficiency as the Farmhands will leave empty plots on the farm between harvesting and planting berries (Farm Hands first attempt to harvest as many berries as they can, and then plant new berries if there are no berries left to harvest).
+ Maximum Efficiency - Set the Farm Hand to use the proper berry, plant the Farm Hands' Efficiency stat / 2 number of berries as a group at a time, each grouping being at least the Farmhands Work Speed stat apart. This setup takes a bit of time, but earns you more FP per hour, and once the setup is done you can ignore the farm until you have sufficient FP. This will lead to the farmhand harvesting and replanting the berry grouping as soon as they can, earning more FP with less wasted time. For example, using Bailey while farming Lum, plant groups of up to 6 berries at a time, each 5 minutes or more apart for maximum efficiency.
