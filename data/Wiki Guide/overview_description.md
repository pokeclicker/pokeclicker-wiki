##### This is a guide for how to help contribute to the wiki.

## How to edit pages
Currently, there are two ways to edit the wiki:
* by opening a Pull Request to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pokeclicker/pokeclicker-wiki). This method is needed to create **new pages** and to edit **HTML pages**.
* by logging into the wiki through a Discord account. This method only works for editing **existing Markdown pages**.
*We will be working on adding a better tool in the future.*

### Editing Markdown pages
To edit Markdown pages, you can test your changes by pressing the **edit** icon in the top right corner of each page and changing the Markdown.
The changes will be shown live, and can then be added using either the GitHub website, or your GitHub tool of choice.
All of the standard Markdown tools & syntax should be available. If anything is missing, ask for it on Discord!
You can see some tips for Markdown below, like how to make links for other wiki pages.

### Editing HTML pages
To test your changes to HTML pages, you need to run the site locally. This can be done using a tool like VS Code's "Live Server".
All game data is available for use in the HTML pages, using the framework Knockout (just like what the game is using).
To run it locally, you might need to run the command `git submodule update --remote`.

### Editing JavaScript
You will very rarely need to edit the JavaScript files. It's only used for general stuff, which should work by now.
Try to write page specific JavaScript in Knockout, if possible.
You can run `npm start` to see your changes and test if they've worked. This will also keep the `bundle.js` file updated with your changes.
Otherwise after you have edited a JavaScript file, you need to run `npm run build` so the `bundle.js` file has your changes applied.

### Page structure
Each page needs to have one or two HTML pages in the `pages` folder. The `overview.html` file should always be included. This is used to either display an overview for pages with more than one page (like `Pokémon`), or the full page for pages with no sub-pages (like `Farm`).
The `main.html` file is used for a bunch of pages, where we can autogenerate the page-specific content. Like the Pokémon page, all the stats can be pulled from the game data, so there's no need to make a page for each individual Pokémon.

Here is a table of how a page is built, and which files should be changed to change content. We will be using `Berries` as example:
Page Element | File | File for example | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Page Title | Autogenerated | - | This is the title of the page. It's generated from the link.
Page description | data/"Page type"/overview_description.md OR data/"Page type"/"name"_description.md | data/Berries/overview_description.md OR data/Berries/Cheri_description.md | A short description in the start of the page. Uses Markdown.
Table of Contents | Autogenerated | - | This is the Table of Contents. It will be autogenerated from the headers of the page.
Autogenerated page | pages/"Page type"/overview.html OR pages/"Page type"/"Page name".html | pages/berries/overview.html OR pages/berries/main.html | A HTML page with all the stuff that can be generated. Uses Knockout. overview.html should contain a list of the subpages (if any). main.html should fetch data from the games data, based on "Page name". If you are unsure how to generate stuff, or if stuff can be generated, please ask in the discord.
Page content | data/"Page type"/overview.md OR data/"Page type"/"name".md | data/Berries/overview.md OR data/Berries/Cheri.md | All the content that we cannot autogenerate. Uses Markdown.
