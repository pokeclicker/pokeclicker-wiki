Quest Lines are a special type of Quest that requires the player to follow a series of steps to unlock progress in the current Region, unlock certain mechanics, or receive various rewards such as Items and Pokémon. Some quest lines are activated upon progressing to a certain point in the game, while others can be accepted at a Bulletin Board.

## Bulletin Boards
Bulletin boards are located in **starting towns** and offer optional quest lines that the player can choose to accept.
