## Acquisition
The Charti berry can be mutated by equipping the [[Oak Items/Cell Battery]] while there is a [[Berries/Cornn]] berry at Taller stage or later in the [[Farm]]. The Cornn berry will then mutate into a Charti berry.

If the "No Oak Items" challenge is on, the Charti berry can be bought from the Johto Berry Master for 10,000 Farm Points after unlocking [[Berries/Cornn]].
