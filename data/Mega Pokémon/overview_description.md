To evolve a Pokémon into its Mega form you need three things:
1. A Mega Stone (see the table below).
2. Raise the attack of the Pokémon to 500 times its base attack value.
3. Purchase a [[Items/Key Stone]] evolution item from [[Towns/Shalour City]] or [[Towns/A Tree Maybe]] for 25,000 Battle Points.

When the above conditions are met the Pokémon can be evolved by selecting the Key Stone in the Evolution Items menu.
