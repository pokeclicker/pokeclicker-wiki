Hatchery Helpers are people that can be hired to work on your Pokémon Day Care to automate the [[Hatchery]].
Many can be unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements, while others can be purchased from certain Shops.
Once hired, a Hatchery Helper will work until they are fired or you do not have the necessary funds to continue to employ them.

## Usage {#Usage}
Clicking on "Sort" opens a dropdown that allows you to select the order in which Hatchery Helpers will pull Pokémon from Party.
The filters choosen in the hatchery will be shared with hatchery helpers and queue
Pokémon that are currently queued will not be able to be selected by Hatchery Helpers.
You can only have a maximum of 3 hatchery helpers hired at a time.

## Stats {#Stats}
Hatchery Helpers have 3 important stats: Cost, Step Efficiency and Attack Efficiency (see below).
At this time, Hatchery Helpers don't cost you anything when there are no eggs to hatch.
Each individual Hatchery Helper gains Step Efficiency and Attack Efficiency the more Pokemon that they hatch, up to a limit of 50% bonus in each stat.
As an example, Hatchery Helper Sam can thus have up to 60% Step Efficiency and 60% Attack Efficiency.
Maxing out a Hatchery Helpers stats takes 125,000 Pokemon Hatched by that helper.
