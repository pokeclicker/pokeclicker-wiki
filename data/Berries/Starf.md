## Mutation Strategy {#mutation}

### Possible Planting Formations {#planting}

Starf can be obtained by capturing a shiny Wandering Pokémon while at least 1 plot on the [[Farm]] is empty. To start encountering Wandering Pokémon you need at least 1 ripe berry on your farm. There are two recommended setups to obtain Starf berries.

#### Roseli Setup
You can fill your farm in the following way to have a chance to obtain Starf berries without any additional berries. Note that the setup omits a 24th Roseli, as that would allow [[Berries/Custap]] berries to mutate, and omits a 23rd Roseli as that would allow [[Berries/Lansat]] Berries to mutate if [[Pokémon/Dialga]] has been caught. Purple squares indicate where Starf can spawn upon successfully capturing a shiny.

#### Roseli + Lum Setup
You can fill your farm in the following way to have the best chance to obtain Starf berries. Purple squares indicate where Starf can spawn upon successfully capturing a shiny.

#### Important Notes
If possible it is highly recommended to obtain at least 8 [[Berries/Passho]] berries, and if possible 4 [[Berries/Lum]] berries, prior to obtaining the Starf Berry mutation. Without any Passho berries surrounding the Starf plot, harvesting a Starf plant even with a [[Items/Rich Mulch]] applied will only ever yield 1 Starf Berry. Furthermore, harvesting a single ripe Starf berry with the maximum yield modifier (surrounded by ripe Passho berries [8 spots] that are all bordered by at least one Lum berry, and with a rich mulch applied to the plot the Starf is on) will still only yield 10 harvested Starf berries. It is necessary to use at least a combination of Passho berries and Rich Mulch to increase the total amount of Starf berries one has with the exception of finding additional Starf berries or using the [[Berries/Enigma]] berry.
